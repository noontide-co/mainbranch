# PRD: v0.2 First-Run + Daily Briefing

## Summary

Main Branch v0.2.0 should prove the new product shape without building a
dashboard first.

The release should make `mb` feel like the front door to a GitHub-native
business operating system:

1. bare `mb` gives a polished interactive launch screen;
2. `mb onboard` guides humans through setup or repo connection;
3. `mb status` gives a cheap daily business/repo briefing;
4. `mb start` makes the handoff to Claude Code explicit and repairable;
5. `mb update` keeps the install and bundled workflows current.

This release does not need full integrations, a live dashboard, autonomous
agents, or multi-runtime execution. It needs to turn the first-run and daily-run
loops into a coherent product.

## Problem

The v0.1 CLI works, but it assumes the user already understands the system.

Current behavior:

- `mb init` scaffolds a repo but does not teach or adapt.
- Bare `mb` behaves like a traditional command reference.
- The handoff to Claude Code is mostly copy/paste guidance.
- `/start` carries the daily entry surface, but `mb` does not yet give a
  pre-runtime status view.
- GitHub is present, but not yet reframed as the business team layer.

This is enough for technical early adopters. It is not enough for the operator
who needs to be taught why git, GitHub, Claude Code, and local files matter.

## Goals

- Make first-run feel intentional, educational, and safe.
- Respect both beginners and power users.
- Preserve scriptability and boring CLI behavior where required.
- Establish `mb status` as the reusable daily briefing primitive.
- Make the Claude Code handoff explicit, diagnosable, and repairable.
- Create terminal output that feels like a product, not a scaffolding script.
- Keep all canonical business state in the repo.

## Non-Goals

- No dashboard/server process in v0.2.0.
- No background daemon.
- No model invocation inside `mb`.
- No full multi-runtime adapter execution.
- No Google/Meta/Postiz/Cloudflare analytics sync yet.
- No secrets/credentials system beyond what is already required for current
  doctor checks.
- No database/index beyond cheap reads from git, filesystem, and GitHub CLI.

## Target Users

### Beginner

They have little or no terminal/GitHub experience. They need confidence, plain
language, and the "why" behind the stack.

Success for this user: they can install, create a repo, understand that GitHub
is where the business work lives, and start Claude Code without feeling lost.

### Intermediate

They have GitHub or terminal exposure but do not yet think of GitHub as a
business operating layer.

Success for this user: they can connect or create a repo, understand the file
taxonomy, and know when to use `mb` vs Claude Code.

### Power User

They already live in git, GitHub, and terminal tools.

Success for this user: they can skip education, inspect raw commands, connect an
existing repo, and see useful status/JSON surfaces quickly.

## User Experience Principles

- Teach the model, not only the mechanics.
- Let users skip explanations.
- Use business language by default, raw GitHub language when useful.
- Make the terminal warmer without turning it into a toy.
- Keep failure messages repair-oriented.
- Never hide where data lives.
- Never put secrets in repo files.

## Product Scope

### 1. Bare `mb` Launch Screen

Linked issue: #184

When a user runs `mb` with no arguments in an interactive terminal, show a
polished launch screen.

Required routes:

- "New here?" -> `mb onboard`
- "Daily work" -> `mb status`
- "Open agent runtime" -> `mb start`
- "Fix/check setup" -> `mb doctor`
- "Power user commands" -> normal command reference

TTY rules:

- Interactive TTY: show launch screen.
- Non-TTY: keep deterministic help/exit behavior.
- `mb --help`: always show plain command reference.
- Tests must cover TTY vs non-TTY behavior.

Tone:

- Light trail/retro flavor is allowed.
- No giant ASCII wall by default.
- Must be fast to render.
- Must not require reading a long story before using the tool.

Acceptance:

- Bare `mb` in a normal terminal shows the launch screen.
- `mb --help` stays plain.
- Piped/non-interactive invocation does not hang or prompt.
- Launch screen links to real commands that exist or clearly say "coming next"
  only inside this release branch before implementation lands.

### 2. `mb onboard`

Linked issue: #185

`mb onboard` is the human setup flow. `mb init` remains the quiet, scriptable
primitive.

Required capabilities:

- Detect or ask experience level:
  - terminal familiarity;
  - GitHub familiarity;
  - Claude Code installed/known;
  - existing repo vs new repo.
- Offer three paths:
  - beginner guided setup;
  - intermediate setup with shorter explanations;
  - power-user setup with advanced options and minimal copy.
- Create a new repo through `mb init` or connect an existing repo.
- Explain why GitHub is used as the team/business layer.
- Explain where canonical business state lives.
- Wire Claude Code skills through existing skill-link code.
- Verify skill discovery and runtime readiness through doctor/status checks.
- End with exact next commands.

Suggested beginner flow:

1. Welcome/launch screen.
2. "Have you used GitHub before?"
3. "Create new business repo or connect existing?"
4. Business name and repo path.
5. Short explanation: GitHub = tasks/conversations/history, repo = business
   brain, Claude Code = first execution runtime.
6. Scaffold/connect.
7. Verify `gh`, `git`, `claude`, skill wiring.
8. Show daily ritual.

Power-user requirements:

- `--yes` or equivalent fast path for smoke tests.
- `--path`, `--name`, and existing repo options.
- No forced educational copy.

Acceptance:

- Re-running is idempotent.
- Existing initialized repo is detected and repaired, not overwritten.
- Missing `gh` or Claude Code results in clear repair instructions.
- Does not require a GitHub API write for local-only setup.
- Produces `--json` output or a clear future path for automation.

### 3. `mb status`

Linked issue: #173

`mb status` is the first daily briefing primitive. It should be cheap, local
first, and useful before any dashboard exists.

Required sections:

- Repo:
  - path;
  - whether it looks like a Main Branch repo;
  - git branch and dirty/clean state;
  - install mode and Main Branch version.
- Runtime:
  - Claude Code found/missing;
  - skill wiring found/missing;
  - suggested repair command.
- Brain:
  - counts for core, research, decisions, campaigns/log/documents;
  - recent research;
  - recent decisions;
  - stale proposed/running decisions if detectable.
- GitHub, when `gh` is authenticated:
  - assigned open issues;
  - review requests or mentions if available cheaply;
  - recent merged PRs;
  - blocked/stale labels where present.
- Next actions:
  - one to five deterministic suggestions based on checks.

Output modes:

- human terminal summary by default;
- `--json` with stable top-level sections;
- degraded mode when `gh`, network, or git data is unavailable.

Acceptance:

- Runs in under a few seconds on a normal repo.
- Does not invoke a model.
- Does not modify repo files.
- Does not require GitHub auth to be useful.
- `/start` can later call or mimic its data model.

### 4. `mb start`

Linked issue: #186

`mb start` is the runtime handoff helper.

Required behavior:

- Resolve target repo:
  - current directory if it is a Main Branch repo;
  - `--repo <path>` override;
  - future recent-repos support can come later.
- Run the handoff-relevant subset of `mb status` or `mb doctor`.
- Verify Claude Code is installed.
- Verify skill wiring.
- Print the exact command:

```bash
cd <repo>
claude
# then run /start
```

Optional behavior:

- `--launch` may run `claude` directly if safe.
- `--json` emits command, repo path, runtime, and readiness.

Acceptance:

- Does not invoke a model itself.
- Handles missing Claude Code with install guidance.
- Handles missing skill wiring with `mb skill link --repo <path>`.
- Safe to run repeatedly.

### 5. `mb update`

Linked issue: #174

`mb update` should own the install-mode-aware refresh mechanism that `/pull`
can later call or explain.

Required behavior:

- Detect install mode:
  - pipx/PyPI;
  - editable/source clone;
  - unknown.
- For pipx installs, recommend or run `pipx upgrade mainbranch`.
- For clone/source mode, recommend or run `git pull --ff-only`.
- Repair skill links after update when needed.
- Print what changed or where to read changelog when available.

Acceptance:

- Safe dry-run mode.
- Clear output for pipx vs clone mode.
- Does not corrupt editable installs.

## Data and State

v0.2.0 should use only:

- repo files;
- git metadata;
- existing `.claude/` skill wiring;
- existing local config if present;
- GitHub CLI reads where authenticated.

Do not add a database in v0.2.0. Do not add background sync. Do not add a
dashboard server.

## CLI/API Requirements

Every new command should support:

- human terminal output;
- clear exit codes;
- no hangs in non-interactive mode;
- testable functions below the Typer command layer;
- JSON output where another skill/runtime/dashboard will likely consume it.

Suggested exit code conventions:

- `0`: usable / success;
- `1`: expected user-fixable issue;
- `2`: command/runtime error;
- `130`: user canceled.

## Copy and Language

Use business-first language, with raw terms in parentheses when helpful.

Examples:

- "tasks (GitHub issues)"
- "proposals/conversations (pull requests)"
- "what shipped (merged PRs)"
- "business brain (your repo)"

Avoid overclaiming. v0.2.0 is still terminal-first and Claude-Code-first.

Everything not listed above stays backlog unless explicitly pulled forward.

## Open Questions

- Should bare `mb` route to `mb status` by default after onboarding has run?
- Should `mb onboard` create GitHub repos through `gh` or only local repos in
  v0.2.0?
- Should `mb start --launch` exist in v0.2.0 or should it only print commands?
- What is the minimum useful GitHub read for `mb status` without slowing it down?
- Where should recent repo selection live: local config now or wait for v0.2.1?

## Definition of Done

v0.2.0 is done when a fresh user can:

1. install Main Branch;
2. run `mb`;
3. choose onboarding;
4. create or connect a business repo;
5. run `mb status` and understand the repo state;
6. run `mb start` and reach Claude Code with clear `/start` instructions;
7. update Main Branch through `mb update`;
8. recover from common missing-tool states through clear repair guidance.

Development work for this release should follow the agent workflow and runtime
eval ladder in
[`docs/prd/v0-2-agent-workflow-and-evals.md`](v0-2-agent-workflow-and-evals.md).
In particular, CLI tests are not enough for first-run work: changes that affect
skill discovery, runtime handoff, or `/start` need a Claude Code smoke or an
explicit note explaining why it could not be run.
