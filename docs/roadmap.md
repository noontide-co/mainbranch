# Roadmap

This roadmap is direction, not a promise. GitHub issues and release notes are
the detailed execution record. This file explains the product shape so users,
contributors, and agents understand where Main Branch is going.

Main Branch is not only a marketing-growth context folder. Growth is the first
high-value wedge because ads, pages, content, and launches expose the memory
problem quickly. The broader product is durable operating memory for
AI-assisted businesses: meetings, fulfillment, bookkeeping summaries, provider
refs, decisions, bets, pushes, logs, and lessons in repos the team owns.

## Shipped Foundation

Main Branch already ships:

- public PyPI package and MIT-licensed engine;
- `mb onboard`, `mb init`, `mb status`, `mb start`, `mb update`, `mb doctor`,
  `mb graph`, `mb validate`, `mb migrate`, `mb connect`, and skill management
  commands;
- `mb doctor repair --plan` / `--apply` and migration drift detection across
  `mb validate` and `mb doctor` for stale generated guidance, legacy
  active-write folders, stale Claude settings, wrong push/playbook paths, and
  legacy bet campaign links;
- Claude Code skill wiring with `mb-` prefixed bundled skills;
- beginner setup, migration, repair, and update paths;
- local-first provider metadata and secret-safe connection checks;
- graph, status, and topology primitives (including repo-topology facts in
  `mb status --json`, `mb graph --json`, and `mb doctor repair --plan --json`)
  for future dashboard and agent workflows;
- MoneyPath readiness in `mb status --json --peek`, so daily status can show
  whether customer progress, offer, proof, CTA, channel, push, playbook, page,
  and outcome feedback are legible and connected without turning CLI output
  into strategic judgment;
- privacy-safe GitHub issue drafting and submission (`mb issue draft`,
  `mb issue open`) for user friction;
- push, reusable playbook, and per-push run-record vocabulary for coordinated
  business work;
- `bets/` and `/mb-bet` as the first Reflect primitive;
- `mb checkpoint` as the first hidden GitOps save layer for long agent runs;
- materialized release-simulation fixtures and the package-visible release
  evidence ladder (PR smoke, pre-release candidate, release acceptance);
- public contribution, support, security, compatibility, and agent guidance;
- accepted workspace/repo/sensitive-data boundary guidance and
  GitHub/Obsidian-compatible markdown/link conventions for future dashboard,
  team daily log, bookkeeping, and multi-repo work;
- initial paid-traffic site readiness checks through `mb site check`.

Claude Code is the supported runtime today. Codex CLI has an experimental
CLI-first adapter; other runtimes are compatibility targets until adapter code
and smoke evidence exist.

## Current Direction: Make The Daily Loop Boring

The current product step is making the normal day feel coherent: open the
business repo, start Claude Code, ask `/mb-start`, see what matters, repair what
is stale, ship the next piece of work, and save a readable checkpoint before
moving on.

In one pass, the loop is:

1. **Start grounded.** `/mb-start`, generated repo instructions, or `mb start`
   should make the agent read deterministic `mb` facts before making claims.
2. **Route the thought dump.** A messy operator update should become a business
   primitive: bet, research, decision, push, playbook, outcome, log entry, or
   checkpoint.
3. **Use the right layer.** Claude Code skills handle judgment, synthesis,
   writing, review, and routing. `mb` handles enforcement: repo shape, graph
   links, status health, provider readiness, updates, repairs, validation, and
   guarded commits.
4. **Hide the plumbing, preserve the memory.** Issues, branches, pull requests,
   commits, graph links, and provider refs exist so the business can inspect
   what happened later. The user-facing language should stay business-readable.
5. **Close the loop.** `/mb-end` and checkpoint guidance turn the session into
   durable git-backed memory before the next day starts.

The work clusters into a few durable buckets:

- **Start and status.** `/mb-start`, `/mb-status`, and `mb status` should read
  the same facts: since-last-check changes, ranked next actions, drift,
  onboarding progress, update severity, provider readiness, GitHub
  tasks/proposals, MoneyPath readiness, and recent business activity.
- **Repair and migration.** `mb doctor`, `mb doctor repair`, `mb update`, and
  `mb migrate` should make stale installs, old repo layouts, broken skill
  wiring, ignored local state, and provider setup problems visible and
  repairable without asking a non-developer to reason through git plumbing.
- **Business-readable history.** Checkpoints should feel like saved business
  progress, not developer ceremony. The git journal should become a readable
  timeline for status, handoff, retros, and future dashboards.
- **Pushes and growth workflows.** Ads, organic content, sales videos, sites, research,
  bets, and coordinated pushes remain the strongest shipped wedge. `pushes/` is
  the official folder for coordinated work; `campaigns/` remains a
  compatibility read for older repos.
- **Provider rails.** Cloudflare, GitHub, Google/Workspace, ads providers,
  Apify, Postiz-style social scheduling, and future sidecars should enter
  through explicit, tested rails with approval gates where money, publishing,
  account mutation, or customer contact is involved.
- **Issue and friction capture.** Confusing errors, missing workflows, and
  repeated repair steps should turn into privacy-safe issue drafts so real use
  improves the public engine.

Current public implementation anchors are GitHub issues, not promises in this
roadmap. Check live issues before using any anchor as current scope. For this
phase, the durable topic cluster is generated repo guidance, migration lint,
topology/status/graph facts, child repo descriptors, reusable playbooks,
runtime dogfood, provider readiness, and issue/friction capture. Link specific
issue numbers only after verifying their state on GitHub.

Anti-scope for v0.3.x:

- no dashboard as source of truth;
- no broad multi-runtime support claims;
- no marketplace;
- no automatic model invocation from `mb`;
- no provider setup that stores secrets in repo files.

## Soon: Dashboard, Sidecars, And Multi-Repo Views

Once the daily operating loop is boring, Main Branch should make the broader
business system easier to see without replacing the repo as source of truth.

Planned scope:

- a small read-only local dashboard over existing JSON outputs;
- visual multi-repo inventory for business repos, site repos, offer repos, and
  sensitive/private repos, with explicit access boundaries;
- a dashboard map of repos, pushes, bets, commits, issues, PRs, checkpoints,
  provider-safe summaries, and sidecar summaries;
- sidecar enrichment contracts for optional tools such as public company
  context, analytics, bookkeeping, transcription, deployment helpers, and
  provider metrics;
- team daily log surfaces built from commits, checkpoints, issues, PRs, and
  explicit `log/` files instead of treating raw chat as source of truth;
- finance/legal warnings and access-boundary views that make sensitive repos
  obvious without pulling private raw data into shared business memory.

Candidate directions stay candidates until a decision, adapter, and smoke
evidence promote them. That includes dashboard write surfaces, broader provider
mutation, social scheduling rails, growth automation execution, and non-Claude
runtime adapters.

Anti-scope:

- no dashboard database as the source of business memory;
- no Slack replacement claim before repo truth, GitHub activity, team logs, and
  permission boundaries are proven;
- no finance/legal raw data in shared repos by default;
- no "connect every SaaS" hub. Provider rails are curated, official where
  possible, deterministic, smoke-tested, and optional.

## Later: Bets And Pushes Become Operating Systems

The next proof point after the daily decision loop is graduating real business
bets into offers, pages, ads, fulfillment, and public Ship surfaces.

Planned scope:

- links between bets, decisions, research, pushes, and outcomes;
- public bets feed generated through site workflows;
- offer launch workflows that connect research, keyword gates, landers, ads,
  organic distribution, tracking, and `/mb-start` orchestration;
- deterministic site/CMS rails over Cloudflare Pages, DNS, GitHub, and
  operator-approved measurement checks;
- decisions on Ops surfaces (books, P&L, compliance) and fulfillment scope;
- bookkeeping/P&L primitives that respect finance-data privacy boundaries
  while still giving operators useful summaries.

## Longer Range

Longer-range work should preserve the same state model: business truth in git,
local operational state outside git, and live process state only when explicit.

Likely directions:

- runtime adapters for Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes, Paperclip-adjacent
  orchestration, and local runtimes;
- dashboard/server mode as an optional local or self-hosted view over repo
  truth, graph output, GitHub, and connected tools;
- structured data layer for metrics, ads, analytics, P&L, and ledgers, with
  explicit access boundaries before sensitive financial/legal data is surfaced;
- richer sidecar ecosystem behind narrow JSON contracts;
- deeper Paid, Organic, Pages, and Ops workflows under the four-pillar framing;
- optional chat or team-communication surfaces that convert important
  conversation into durable artifacts: issues, proposals, decisions, pushes,
  logs, and commits.
