# Repo Visibility Rubric

Main Branch keeps the user's business in a git repo. That repo can live
locally, on a personal GitHub account, in a free GitHub organization, or in a
paid GitHub team or organization. None of those choices change whether the
repo's source files and full change history are visible to the public.

This rubric exists so `/mb-setup`, `/mb-site`, and any future tooling ask the
right question once and stop assuming.

The product stance is in
[`decisions/2026-05-11-repo-setup-visibility-and-checks-model.md`](../decisions/2026-05-11-repo-setup-visibility-and-checks-model.md).

## The Core Rule

> Public output does not require public source.

A public website on Cloudflare can ship from a private GitHub repo. The
working files, drafts, copy iterations, and revision history can stay private
even when the deployed site is fully public.

A second rule keeps the words honest:

> Local git shape, setup stage, and remote permission role are separate axes.

A repo can be local-only, personal, in a free organization, or in a paid
team. Workflow mode (`solo-on-main`, `branch`, `worktree`, `detached`)
describes how the operator is working in the checkout. Visibility describes
whether strangers can read the source. Permission describes whether the
current operator can push. These do not interlock.

## What "Public Repo" And "Private Repo" Actually Mean

A **public repo** means:

- the source files are visible to anyone with the URL;
- the commit history is visible, including the messages and diffs;
- pull request and issue threads are visible by default;
- a stranger can clone the repo and read everything in it.

A **private repo** means:

- only invited collaborators can read the source or history;
- the deployed site, the public README, public docs, or public release
  artifacts can still be fully public — those are separate publication
  channels.

A private repo is **not** a secret repo. It is a working space with normal
access controls.

## What Private Business Information Covers

Treat the following as private by default unless there is a specific reason
to publish:

- offer experiments that have not shipped;
- client work and client identifiers;
- draft sites, draft copy, and copy iterations;
- strategy, plans, and operating notes;
- screenshots of dashboards, inboxes, or accounts;
- raw provider exports, customer rows, and analytics dumps;
- reports and internal write-ups;
- bets, decisions, research, and pushes while they are in progress;
- anything that would create risk, confusion, embarrassment, competitive
  disadvantage, client trust issues, or operational noise if a stranger
  saw it.

When the operator is unsure, the answer is private.

## Defaults By Repo Role

| Repo role | Visibility default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Business repo | **Private** | Holds offers, strategy, decisions, drafts, and operating history. Public business repos are the exception. |
| Site repo | **Private** | Ships a public site via Cloudflare without exposing copy iterations, working drafts, or revision history. |
| Data/source-record repo | **Private** | Raw exports, customer rows, provider caches, and internal memory belong here. Never public. |
| Open-source tool, template, demo, or public doc repo | **Public** | The source itself is the product. |

## The One Question To Ask For Site Repos

`/mb-site` and `/mb-setup` should ask exactly one question before creating a
site repo:

> Should the source files and full change history be public?

Default to **private**. If the operator says yes, they want public source,
proceed with a public repo. Otherwise create the repo private and let
Cloudflare deploy the public site from the private repo. Do not ask the
operator to choose a hosting or deploy platform during the normal flow;
Cloudflare is the adopted rail.

If the operator answers "I want the deployed site to be public," that is
not the same answer. Re-read this question with them. Public deploy is a
Cloudflare concern; public source is a GitHub concern.

## When Public Source Is The Right Call

Public source is appropriate when the source itself is intentionally public:

- open-source tools, libraries, and CLI projects;
- public templates and starters;
- public docs sites whose content lives in the repo;
- demos and reference implementations;
- build-in-public projects where the operator deliberately shares iteration.

In every other case, default to private and revisit if the operator's
strategy changes.

## What Visibility Does Not Decide

Visibility does not decide:

- **Where the repo lives.** Local-only, personal GitHub, free org, paid
  org, or self-hosted Git are separate choices. See the repo home rubric in
  the [setup-and-checks decision](../decisions/2026-05-11-repo-setup-visibility-and-checks-model.md).
- **Whether GitHub costs money.** GitHub organizations are free. Paid plans
  exist for advanced team controls, support, or higher private-repo
  collaboration limits, but a private repo on a free personal account or a
  free organization is fine.
- **Whether the deployed site is public.** That is a Cloudflare deploy
  question.
- **Whether the operator has push access.** That is a permission question
  handled by publish planning.

## Pairing Private Source With A Public Site

The normal Main Branch site loop is:

1. Operator creates or selects a private GitHub repo for the site.
2. `/mb-site` writes the site files (or generates a minisite) into that
   private repo.
3. `mb connect cloudflare` and `mb site check` confirm Cloudflare readiness.
4. Cloudflare Pages deploys from the private GitHub repo to the public
   domain.
5. The deployed URL is public; the source repo and its commit history stay
   private.

This is normal. It is the default.
