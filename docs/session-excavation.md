# Session Excavation

Use this workflow when a customer call, setup session, exported chat log,
runtime transcript, or agent session export should improve Main Branch.

The goal is to turn real usage into a prioritized, public-safe backlog. Raw
sessions are source material, not product truth. Durable outputs should be
sanitized GitHub issues, docs, decisions, tests, skill updates, or evidence
reports.

## When To Use This

Use session excavation for:

- first-run setup calls;
- customer onboarding calls;
- exported Claude Code, Codex, or other agent-runner sessions;
- webinar transcripts and chat logs;
- runtime dogfood transcripts that are not release validation;
- generated business-repo history after a live session;
- repeated support conversations that expose the same friction.

For release-bearing runtime validation, use
[`release-simulations.md`](release-simulations.md) and
[`release-agent-contract.md`](release-agent-contract.md) first. This document
is for product excavation from real usage, not for replacing release evidence.

## Privacy Boundary

Raw transcripts, chat logs, customer/member data, local paths, account details,
private business strategy, proof assets, screenshots, and credentials stay out
of public docs and GitHub comments.

Public artifacts may include:

- sanitized summaries;
- generic reproduction steps;
- category and priority tables;
- short sanitized excerpts only when needed;
- public-safe links to existing docs, issues, or decisions;
- decisions about what surface should change.

Private artifacts may include:

- raw transcript paths;
- exact local file paths;
- customer names, customer repo names, and member names;
- sensitive proof/legal details;
- internal operator notes;
- screenshots or logs that contain private context.

Keep private evidence in ignored local scratch space such as `.agent/`, an
agent-runner scratch directory, or OS temp, or in Linear-only comments when the
tool clearly supports keeping the note private. Do not copy private Linear
evidence into public GitHub comments or PR bodies.

## Source Inventory

Start by listing the evidence set before analysis:

| Source | Private location | Public-safe description | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transcript or chat export | local scratch path | Customer setup transcript | User questions, confusion, language, trust risks |
| Runtime/session export | local scratch path | Agent session export | Actual commands, tool errors, runtime behavior |
| Generated business repo | local or private repo | Resulting business repo history | File quality, checkpoint quality, privacy boundaries |
| Existing issue/PR | public URL | Work thread | Prior scope, open questions, linked follow-ups |

Do not commit this inventory if it names private paths or customers. Commit
only a sanitized version when it is useful as a public report.

## Analysis Passes

Read the session in passes. Do not start with broad product wishes.

1. **Actual errors:** setup failures, wrong commands, broken skill discovery,
   failed validation, accidental files, dirty repos, bad commits, tool crashes,
   or confusing recovery paths.
2. **Trust and safety:** private data exposure, proof permission gaps,
   credential risks, money-spend/publish/contact actions, runtime overclaims,
   or customer-visible statements the product cannot support.
3. **User experience:** questions the user had to ask, points where the
   operator translated technical terms, places where the agent needed a rescue
   phrase, and moments where the next step was unclear.
4. **Language:** git, terminal, provider, and runtime terms that should be
   translated into business language first.
5. **Saved history:** checkpoint quality, commit grouping, accidental cleanup
   commits, stale source material, and whether the final history tells a useful
   business story.
6. **Workflow gaps:** missing source-ingestion flows, review gates, repo
   boundary decisions, provider readiness, dashboards, or other repeated
   operator loops.
7. **Provider and connector boundaries:** connector setup friction, bridge or
   restart requirements, OAuth scope confusion, direct provider writes, secret
   handling, account mutation, and whether a provider path is `mb`-native,
   runtime-native, plugin-based, CLI/API-key-based, or unsupported.
   Provider smoke evidence should record presence, exit status, and readiness
   facts, never credential values or token prefixes.
8. **Roadmap signal:** useful future direction that should not become an
   immediate support claim.

Separate facts from inferences. A fact is visible in the transcript, logs, repo
history, or generated files. An inference is a likely product implication that
needs a follow-up issue, decision, or test.

## Priority Ladder

Use this severity ladder by default:

| Priority | Meaning | Typical action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Actual failure, safety risk, privacy risk, or trust-breaking output | Open or attach a concrete issue; add tests or smoke plan |
| P1 | Adoption blocker, repeated confusion, stale workflow, or user-facing quality gap | Open a scoped issue or document an explicit defer |
| P2 | Important workflow improvement or validated product pull | Add to backlog or fold into an existing issue |
| P3 | Education, polish, roadmap signal, or optional enhancement | Record only if it helps future prioritization |

Actual observed errors outrank attractive roadmap ideas. Do not let connector
wishes bury setup, privacy, proof, save, or language failures.

## Public Issue Table

Use a compact table for the public issue or public report:

```md
| Priority | Area | Finding | Why it matters | Candidate follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Setup | The pasted setup prompt did not trigger the intended setup flow. | First-run setup should not require an expert rescue phrase. | Add a fixture/runtime smoke for full-guide paste recognition. |
| P1 | Language | The operator had to translate `cd` and commit language live. | Beginner users need folder/save/checkpoint language first. | Audit generated setup and status copy for owner-language leakage. |
```

Keep the table sanitized:

- say "customer", "operator", "business repo", or "member proof" instead of
  naming the person or business;
- use generic local paths such as `<business-repo>`;
- avoid exact raw quotes unless they are short, necessary, and public-safe;
- cite private evidence only in private notes.

## Private Evidence Note

When a public issue needs private backing, add a private note outside public
GitHub with this shape:

```md
Private evidence note. Do not copy into public GitHub.

| Source | Private location | What it showed |
|---|---|---|
| Transcript | <local scratch path> | Setup recovery, user questions, cost concerns |
| Session export | <local scratch path> | Runtime metadata, command output, logs |
| Generated repo | <private repo/path> | Commit history, scratch files, proof status |

| Priority | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P0 setup | Transcript around <time> shows the operator restated the setup intent. | Public issue should describe the failure generically. |
```

## Follow-Up Routing

After the table is drafted, route each P0 and P1 row.

| Finding type | Durable home |
|---|---|
| Reproducible CLI or setup failure | GitHub issue with command, expected behavior, actual behavior, validation target |
| Runtime discovery or skill behavior | GitHub issue with runtime, adapter/support boundary, and smoke plan |
| Public/private leak risk | GitHub issue if generic; private note only if the evidence itself is sensitive |
| Generated repo guidance gap | Skill prose, template, docs, and a fixture/runtime smoke if first-run behavior changes |
| Stale business source handling | Workflow issue, skill update, or decision if it changes repo primitives |
| Provider write or secret handling risk | Provider mutation, approval-gate, or secret-redaction issue with a validation target |
| Connector bridge confusion | Connector-readiness issue or shared-workflow source issue; do not claim runtime support from directory availability alone |
| Transcript or authenticated-community ingestion | Ingestion/privacy issue with manifest-first, skip-filter, and proof-permission requirements |
| Connector/provider request | Provider-readiness issue only after support claim and smoke boundary are clear |
| Roadmap pull | Roadmap note or backlog issue; do not claim support |

For each P0/P1, either:

- open or link a concrete issue;
- attach it to an existing active issue; or
- write a short defer note explaining why it is not being worked now.

## Repeatable Output

End every excavation with:

- public-safe issue/report link;
- P0/P1 routing table;
- private evidence location, if any;
- validation needed for the next implementation branch;
- artifact left behind, if the session taught a repeatable process.

The last bullet matters. If the session reveals a workflow that future agents
will repeat, leave behind a reusable doc, decision, fixture, test, template, or
skill reference instead of only filing another backlog item.
