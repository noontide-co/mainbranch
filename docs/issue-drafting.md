# Privacy-Safe Issue Drafting

Main Branch improves through public friction reports, but business repos can
contain private context. Use `mb issue` when an error, confusing step, missing
workflow, or question should become a GitHub issue.

## Commands

```bash
mb issue draft bug --command "mb status" --what-happened "..." --expected "..."
mb issue draft feature --problem "..." --proposal "..."
mb issue draft question --question "..." --context "..." --tried "..."
```

Drafts are written under `.mb/issue-drafts/` in the active business repo. That
directory is local operational state and should stay gitignored.

Bug drafts include scrubbed `mb doctor --json` output by default. Use
`--no-doctor` when you only want the fields you supplied.

After reviewing the draft:

```bash
mb issue open .mb/issue-drafts/<draft>.md --yes
```

`mb issue open` uses `gh issue create` when GitHub CLI is installed and
authenticated. If `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or `--yes` is omitted, it
prints a browser/manual fallback instead of submitting.

## Privacy Defaults

The scrubber redacts common hazards:

- local absolute paths such as home, temp, volume, and Windows drive paths;
- token-shaped values and bearer tokens;
- sensitive environment lines such as `API_TOKEN=...`;
- URL query secrets such as `?token=...`;
- email addresses.

The scrubber is a guardrail, not a guarantee. Before submitting, review the
draft and remove private business data, customer/member data, account details,
raw files, screenshots with private information, and secrets.

## Skill Convention

Skills should suggest `mb issue draft` only when the operator hits reproducible
friction that would help future users:

- command or setup errors that persist after the documented repair command;
- missing Main Branch workflow surfaces;
- confusing docs or runtime handoff steps;
- questions whose answer belongs in public docs or the issue tracker.

Skills should not file or open issues on their own. They should summarize the
public-safe problem, recommend the matching shape (`bug`, `feature`, or
`question`), and let the operator run `mb issue open ... --yes` after reviewing
the draft.
