"""Every CLI surface must be reachable from each first-class runtime rail.

Operators never browse the CLI. A surface is discoverable on a rail when
that rail's own teaching corpus names it: for Claude Code, the bundled
skills and docs; for Codex, the generated AGENTS.md template and the
shared workflow sources its global skills render from. Python string
literals are not a discovery rail — a surface mentioned only in engine
source is invisible to operators on both runtimes.

History: the first version of this gate pooled everything into one
corpus and passed when a surface was taught on ONE rail (or merely
appeared in .py source). A full cycle of new surfaces shipped Claude-only
before the 2026-06-12 Codex audit caught it. Per-rail assertion makes
that class of asymmetry a failing test.
