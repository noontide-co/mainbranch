# Generated Codex Workflow Guidance: End Checkpoint Save

Source workflow: `workflows/mb-end/workflow.md`
Runtime support: `codex_cli: owner_loop_shell`
Approval gates: `updates_repairs_migrations`, `file_writes`, `checkpoint`, `provider_mutation`, `publishing_or_spend`, `customer_contact`, `private_data`, `destructive_operations`, `public_issue_or_proposal`
Public/private boundaries: `no_secrets`, `no_raw_provider_exports`, `no_raw_transcripts`, `no_customer_member_data`, `no_private_runtime_settings`, `no_raw_finance_legal_records`

Codex is first-class for the proven owner loop only. This guidance is generated
from the engine workflow source for business-repo `AGENTS.md`; the business repo
does not need to contain `workflows/mb-end/workflow.md`. Treat this rendered
route as the Codex shell for natural-language closeout tasks. It does not claim
Claude Code runtime entrypoints work inside Codex or that all Main Branch
workflows are available in Codex.

## Codex Route

Mid-session save vs close: if the operator only wants to save progress and keep
working — "save", "checkpoint this", "yes save" mid-flow — this is a save, not a
close. Run `mb checkpoint --plan`, save on approval through `mb checkpoint`, and
return them to work. Never save with raw git. Use the full closeout below only
when the session is actually ending or pausing.

1. Run a status scan first. Use deterministic status, checkpoint, validation,
   readiness, drift, recent-work, and runtime facts before reading raw git
   details.
2. Build the checkpoint plan from `mb checkpoint --plan --json`; use
   `mb validate --json` for blockers and cite `mb doctor repair --plan` when
   repairs are needed.
3. Give a short session summary in business language: decisions, research,
   offers, pushes, outcomes, changed core truth, and unsaved work.
4. Ask once for final thought capture before closeout. Offer to save a brief
   research note only after operator approval.
5. Run crystallize-lite in-thread when meaningful activity happened, or use
   available subagent tooling when the current Codex session supports it. If
   neither is available, name the limitation and still ask one specific
   crystallize question from the day's facts.
6. Present save state before plumbing: drafted, saved locally, ready to send
   up, sent for review, landed in main, or blocked by unrelated cleanup.
7. Make checkpointing an approval-gated save. Validate the subject, ask before
   saving, and use `mb checkpoint`, not raw git commands.
8. End with a warm close: one sentence naming the most important saved or
   drafted business outcome, without tomorrow planning.

## Handoff Shape

```text
Closeout state: <one owner-facing save state>.
Status scan: <status/checkpoint/validate facts read>.
Session summary: <3-6 bullets or one compact paragraph>.
Final thought: <none, captured, or approved research note target>.
Crystallize: <lite, subagent, or limitation named>.
Checkpoint plan: <subject, changed surfaces, blockers, approval needed>.
Warm close: <one sentence>.
```

Use business language first. Git, branch, pull request, merge, and working-tree
details are secondary unless the operator asks for plumbing. Do not tell Codex
users to run Claude Code entrypoints. Runtime smoke is required before docs say
this selected workflow is supported or available in Codex.
