# Generated Codex Workflow Guidance: Bet Lifecycle

Source workflow: `workflows/mb-bet/workflow.md`
Runtime support: `codex_cli: owner_loop_shell`
Approval gates: `updates_repairs_migrations`, `file_writes`, `checkpoint`, `provider_mutation`, `publishing_or_spend`, `customer_contact`, `private_data`, `destructive_operations`, `structured_collection`, `public_issue_or_proposal`
Public/private boundaries: `no_secrets`, `no_raw_provider_exports`, `no_raw_transcripts`, `no_customer_member_data`, `no_private_runtime_settings`, `no_private_dms_or_gated_communities`, `no_raw_finance_legal_records`, `no_raw_ledger_rows`

Codex uses the global Main Branch `mb-bet` skill as a read-only planning and
file-guidance route. This guidance is generated from the engine workflow source
and does not claim supported lifecycle writes or Claude Code entrypoints in
Codex.

## Codex Route

1. Use the business repo `AGENTS.md` bootstrap posture: read facts first, keep
   writes approval-gated, and translate git/provider details into business
   language.
2. Read deterministic facts before raw markdown: status, start when runtime
   facts matter, repair plan when blockers appear, validation, relationship
   health, checkpoint plan, similar-bets for repeated material theses, and
   aggregate exposure for financially material bets.
3. Bet is a time-boxed wager, not an offer or push. Offers are durable things
   sold; pushes coordinate execution. Bets carry hypothesis, appetite, target,
   deadline, evidence, kill or double-down logic, and verdict.
4. Guide new, update, close, list, and narrate modes from the shared contract,
   but do not claim Codex can perform lifecycle writes until runtime smoke
   proves that surface. Present proposed file edits and ask for explicit
   approval before any durable write.
5. Keep the strict contract for `bets/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`: frontmatter fields,
   body sections, typed links, reverse `linked_bets`, and `## Related links`.
6. Use `mb validate --cross-refs --json` after approved bet or link edits. Use
   the checkpoint plan before offering an approval-gated save.
7. For financially material bets, use aggregate exposure only. Never paste raw
   ledger rows, payees, account names, vault paths, transaction memos, provider
   exports, customer/member records, or secrets.
8. Public-safe narration must come from accepted repo truth. Do not invent
   metrics, results, testimonials, channels, or proof. If `public: false`, ask
   before drafting public copy.
9. Do not publish, spend, contact customers, mutate providers, create dashboard
   work, or promote bet learning into offer truth without accepted evidence,
   an accepted decision, and explicit approval.

## Handoff Shape

```text
Bet mode: <new, update, close, list, or narrate>.
Facts read: <status/start/validate/relationship/exposure/similar-bets facts>.
Bet: <path, status, deadline, appetite, metric, target>.
Evidence: <new evidence, missing evidence, or measured result>.
Exit posture: <kill, double-down, continue, close, or unclear>.
Connections: <decisions, research, pushes, outcomes, offers, or none>.
Public posture: <public-safe, private, needs approval, or not narration>.
Write plan: <files to create/edit or none>.
Approval needed before writes: <yes/no and exact action>.
Next business action: <one clear owner-facing step>.
```

Use business language first. Keep legacy campaign links compatibility-only;
new execution routes through pushes. Runtime smoke is required before docs say
this lifecycle is supported for Codex writes.
