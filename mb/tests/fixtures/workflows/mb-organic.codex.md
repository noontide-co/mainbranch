# Generated Codex Workflow Guidance: Organic Content

Source workflow: `workflows/mb-organic/workflow.md`
Runtime support: `codex_cli: read_only_planning`
Approval gates: `updates_repairs_migrations`, `file_writes`, `checkpoint`, `provider_mutation`, `publishing_or_spend`, `customer_contact`, `private_data`, `destructive_operations`, `structured_collection`, `public_issue_or_proposal`
Public/private boundaries: `no_secrets`, `no_raw_provider_exports`, `no_raw_transcripts`, `no_customer_member_data`, `no_private_runtime_settings`, `no_private_dms_or_gated_communities`, `no_raw_finance_legal_records`

Codex uses the global Main Branch `mb-organic` skill as a read-only planning
and file-guidance route. This guidance is generated from the engine workflow
source and does not claim supported organic drafting writes, publishing,
account mutation, customer contact, or Claude Code entrypoints in Codex.

## Codex Route

1. Use the business repo `AGENTS.md` bootstrap posture: read facts first, keep
   writes approval-gated, and translate git/provider details into business
   language.
2. Read deterministic facts before raw markdown: status, start when runtime
   facts matter, repair plan when blockers appear, content strategy health,
   proof quality, relationship gaps, validation, and checkpoint plan.
3. For mining handoff, route to `mb-think` in Codex-native language for mining,
   scraping, competitor research, transcript extraction, and outside source
   collection. Organic may plan from accepted `research/` handoffs, operator
   excerpts, approved transcripts, and current business truth.
4. Guide plan, video, carousel, static, sales-video-repurpose, or review modes
   from the shared contract. Use content_strategy.overall_state,
   content_strategy.simple_entry_point, content_strategy.layers, and
   content_strategy.findings before parsing raw strategy files.
5. Codex may draft patch-shaped recommendations, sample copy, review notes,
   and exact file targets, then stop before changing files.
6. Name artifact routes as plans only: `pushes/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/push.md`,
   `pushes/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/organic-batch-001.md`, and
   `pushes/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/playbooks/<playbook>.md`.
7. If the operator wants the proposed content applied, route them to Claude
   Code `/mb-organic` or another supported write surface until Codex
   organic-write smoke proves this route. Do not run checkpoint commands or
   post-change validation as if Codex edited files.
8. Keep source/privacy boundaries explicit. Never paste raw provider exports,
   private DMs, gated community threads, raw customer/member records, raw
   transcripts, account details, session cookies, finance/legal records, or
   secrets.
9. Do not publish, schedule, upload to accounts, mutate provider accounts,
   spend, auto-DM, auto-reply, contact customers, or execute provider setup.

## Handoff Shape

```text
Organic mode: <plan, video, carousel, static, sales-video-repurpose, or review>.
Facts read: <status/start/content-strategy/proof/checkpoint facts>.
Source base: <offer, audience, voice, research, sales video, push, account, or missing>.
Channel/account: <platform/account/person layer or not selected>.
Content strategy: <healthy, thin, stale, disconnected, or missing>.
Proof/privacy posture: <public-safe, internal-only, missing permission, or needs summary>.
Artifact route: <push path, batch path, playbook path, or none>.
Write plan: <files to create/edit or planning only>.
Approval needed before writes: <yes/no and exact action>.
Next business action: <one clear owner-facing step>.
```

Use business language first. New coordinated work uses pushes. Legacy content
structures are migration input only. Runtime smoke is required before docs say
this workflow is supported for Codex writes.
