# Generated Codex Workflow Guidance: Repo Setup

Source workflow: `workflows/mb-setup/workflow.md`
Runtime support: `codex_cli: owner_loop_shell`
Approval gates: `updates_repairs_migrations`, `file_writes`, `checkpoint`, `provider_mutation`, `publishing_or_spend`, `customer_contact`, `private_data`, `destructive_operations`, `github_repo_create`
Public/private boundaries: `no_secrets`, `no_raw_provider_exports`, `no_customer_member_data`, `no_private_runtime_settings`, `no_raw_finance_legal_records`

Codex is first-class for the proven owner loop only. This guidance is generated
from the engine workflow source for business-repo `AGENTS.md`; the business repo
does not need to contain `workflows/mb-setup/workflow.md`. Treat this rendered
route as the Codex shell for natural-language daily operating tasks. It does not
claim Claude Code runtime entrypoints work inside Codex or that all Main Branch
workflows are available in Codex.

## Required mb Commands

- `mb --version`
- `mb onboard --help`
- `mb status --json --peek`
- `mb start --json`
- `mb doctor repair --plan`

## Required JSON Fact Paths

- `money_path`
- `money_path.objects.proof.quality`
- `content_strategy`
- `ranked_actions`
- `update`
- `readiness`
- `drift.items`
- `runtime.codex_cli`
- `runtime.claude_code`
- `onboarding`
- `checkpoint`
- `vocabulary`

## Codex Route

1. Treat setup prompts as setup intent and onboarding intent, not as documents to save.
2. Confirm the target folder and inspect setup capability before writes.
3. If `mb` is missing, stop and give the install command. If GitHub backup is requested, check GitHub CLI auth before any GitHub write.
4. Ask before running a write command such as onboarding, repo creation, file scaffolding, GitHub remote/push, repair apply, migration apply, or checkpoint save.
5. After approved setup, rerun status/start facts and report the owner outcome before command receipts.

## Handoff Shape

```text
Setup state: <not started, target confirmed, created, connected, ready,
or blocked>.
Target folder: <business folder or needs confirmation>.
Facts read: <version/help/status/start/repair facts used>.
Created or planned: <folders, guidance, GitHub backup, checkpoint, or none>.
Owner outcome: <business brain ready, needs approval, or blocked reason>.
Next safe action: <one command or route>.
Approval needed before writes: <yes/no and what action>.
```

Use business language first. Technical commands, runtime wiring, provider refs,
and file paths are receipts after the owner-facing state unless the operator asks
for plumbing. Do not tell Codex users to run Claude Code entrypoints. Runtime
smoke is required before docs say this selected workflow is supported in Codex.
