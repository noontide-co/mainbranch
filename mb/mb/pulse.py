"""Daily business pulse scaffold (`mb pulse init`).

Graduates the pulse shape proven on a live business's daily operator brief:
deterministic no-LLM collectors (date in -> one JSON object out, honest
``{"unavailable": true}`` + non-zero exit on failure), and a repo-local
pulse skill that does the judgment over the JSON — per-channel scorecard,
anomalies, exactly ONE recommended action, a sub-60-line log entry. The
agent is the editor; code never writes the paper.

Division of labor with the surfaces that already exist: ``mb status`` owns
repo-fact triage (drift, overdue bets) and the pulse CONSUMES it as one
source; ``mb canary`` owns invariant pass/fail and its JSON can be wired in
as another collector. The pulse never re-ranks what those already rank.

COLLECTOR_README_TEMPLATE = """# Pulse collectors — the deterministic layer

One script per source, named `collect-<source>.sh`. The pulse skill runs
them and does the judgment; collectors only fetch numbers.

## The collector contract

- **Date in, JSON out.** `bash collect-<source>.sh [YYYY-MM-DD]` (defaults
  to today UTC) prints exactly ONE JSON object on stdout.
- **Honest absence beats invented numbers.** On ANY failure print
  `{"unavailable": true, "source": "<source>", "error": "<token>"}` and
  exit non-zero. The pulse reports the gap; it never guesses.
- **Deterministic and judgment-free.** No LLM calls, no thresholds, no
  recommendations — numbers only. Judgment lives in the pulse skill.
- **Read-only against every provider.** No sends, no spend, no writes.
- **Never print credentials.** Source tokens from your env file; emit only
  derived numbers.
- **One command, no compound wrappers.** Keep each collector runnable as a
  single `bash collect-<source>.sh <date>` so agent permission systems can
  allow it once instead of prompting per tick.

## Adding a collector

Copy `collect-example.sh`, rename the SOURCE, replace the TODO block with
one read-only API pull shaped (via jq) into the numbers your pulse needs.
The comment at the top must say what the source answers for the business.

description: Daily business pulse — run collectors, judge the JSON, name ONE action. Read-only.

# mb-pulse — the daily business pulse

You are the editor of a one-page daily paper about this business. The
collectors fetch the numbers; you do the judgment. Nothing in this skill
sends, spends, or fixes anything.

## Steps

1. **Date.** Default to today UTC; accept an explicit `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. **Collect.** For each script in `core/operations/pulse/collectors/`,
   run `bash core/operations/pulse/collectors/collect-<source>.sh <date>`
   and parse the JSON. An `{"unavailable": true}` result is an honest gap:
   report it as "<source>: unavailable (<error>)" — never substitute a
   guess or yesterday's number.
3. **Repo facts.** Run `mb status --json` and take its ranked actions and
   drift items as one more source. Do NOT re-rank repo facts — status owns
   that triage; the pulse only decides whether today's top repo fact beats
   today's top provider fact.
4. **Judge.** Compose, in order:
   - **Scorecard** — one line per channel/source with the day's numbers
     against the trailing norm.
   - **Anomalies** — only deltas that change what the operator does next.
   - **ONE recommended action** — exactly one, the single highest-leverage
     move for today, with the evidence line that justifies it.
5. **Write the paper.** Save to `log/<date>-{{SLUG}}-pulse.md`, under 60
   lines. If the file exists, append nothing — rerun overwrites it.
6. **Stay read-only.** Route every fix into the business's normal lanes
   (issues, bets, decisions) — the pulse names the move, the operator (or
   their session) makes it.

## Doctrine

- Honest absence beats invented numbers.
- Every anomaly named must be actionable; skip trivia.
- One action. A pulse that recommends three things recommends nothing.
