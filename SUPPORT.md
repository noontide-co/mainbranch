# Support

Use the narrowest support path that matches the problem.

## Setup or usage help

Start local:

```bash
mb doctor
```

If Claude Code does not see `/start`, run this from your business repo:

```bash
mb skill link --repo .
```

Then restart Claude Code and run:

```text
/start
```

For step-by-step setup, read [docs/BEGINNER-SETUP.md](docs/BEGINNER-SETUP.md).
For platform support, read [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).

## Before opening an issue

Please include:

- Check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to see if your issue is fixed in a newer version.
- `mb --version`
- Operating system
- Install mode (`pipx` or clone)
- The command or slash skill you ran
- What happened
- What you expected
- Any relevant output from `mb doctor`

Do not include private business data, member information, API keys, Stripe IDs,
or unreleased client work in a public issue.

## What the paid community covers

The open-source repo gives you the `mb` CLI, bundled skills, schema, and public
docs.

The paid community is for operator-specific help: curated examples, calls,
classroom material, live bets, and support for applying the system to your own
business. The open-source engine remains usable without joining the community.
