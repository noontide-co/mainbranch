# Main Branch Premium

AI-native business operating system. Your reference is the fuel, Claude is the engine.

---

> **FOR CLAUDE: This is the ENGINE repository (vip). Do NOT write files here.**
>
> - Users have READ-ONLY access — they cannot push changes
> - All business data belongs in the USER'S OWN repository
> - If asked to save files, create them in the user's business repo, not here
> - Run `/start` to help users set up their own repo if they don't have one
>
> **For humans:** If you're reading this, your business files should go in YOUR OWN separate repository, not in vip. See `docs/BEGINNER-SETUP.md` for help.

## Philosophy: Active Reference Management

**You learn by building your reference.** No magic passive memory. You:

- **Actively manage** what Claude knows
- **See files change** as decisions get made
- **Synthesize research** into evergreen reference
- **Control** exactly what informs every output

This engagement is the learning. Articulating your offer, audience, angles — you understand your business more deeply than passive memory allows.

**Passive memory keeps you shallow.** Active reference is work, but that work IS the thinking.

**Marketing reflects the present moment.** Markets shift. Reference stays current with reality. What worked last quarter might not land today.

---

## Philosophy: Compound Knowledge

**Each piece of reference makes the next output better.**

1. **Research** → Investigate (dated)
2. **Decide** → Choose with rationale (dated, links to research)
3. **Codify** → Update evergreen reference
4. **Generate** → Skills consume reference
5. **Learn** → Outputs inform new research

Your repo IS the truth. Unlike chat that forgets or hallucinates.

## How It Works

**Engine + Data = Output**

```
vip (ENGINE)          your-repo (DATA)
├── .claude/skills/                   ├── reference/
├── .claude/lenses/                   │   ├── core/

               Skills read reference/,
               output to outputs/
```

**Same engine + different data = different outputs per business.**

Like Unity/Unreal — engine provides capabilities, each game provides assets.

## Folder Structure

Every business repo follows this structure:

```
[business]/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Always loaded - business summary
│
├── reference/             # Evergreen truth (skills consume this)
│   ├── core/              # REQUIRED - same files every business
│   │   ├── offer.md       # What we sell
│   │   ├── audience.md    # Who buys
│   │   └── voice.md       # How we sound (quick reference)

## Domain Rubrics

Every business has a `reference/domain/` folder. Contents depend on business type.

| Business Type | Domain Contents | Rubric |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| **E-commerce** | `products/`, `materials/`, `sizing/` | `.claude/reference/domain-rubrics/ecommerce.md` |
| **Community** | `classroom/`, `funnel/`, `membership/` | `.claude/reference/domain-rubrics/community.md` |
| **SaaS** | `features/`, `pricing/`, `integrations/` | `.claude/reference/domain-rubrics/saas.md` |
| **Content** | `pillars/`, `editorial/` | `.claude/reference/domain-rubrics/content.md` |
| **Service** | `process/`, `deliverables/` | `.claude/reference/domain-rubrics/service.md` |

Use `/setup` skill to scaffold the correct structure for your business type.

---
```

## Multi-Repo Workflow

1. Open your project/client repo as **primary working directory**
2. Add vip as **additional working directory**
3. Skills and lenses become available
4. All outputs go to your project repo

---

## What Lives Where

| Content | Location | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Skills, lenses, rubrics | Engine | Shared with all members |
| Compliance frameworks | Engine | Shared with all members |
| Your offer, audience, voice | Your repo (`reference/core/`) | Business-specific |
| Your brand systems | Your repo (`reference/brand/`) | Business-specific |

## Reference Tiers

Skills load reference progressively to stay token-efficient:

| Tier | What | When Loaded |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Always** | CLAUDE.md | Every session |
| **Core** | reference/core/*.md | When generating |
| **On-demand** | research/, decisions/ | When reasoning about choices |
| **Deep reference** | reference/brand/, reference/proof/ | When writing copy |
| **Domain** | reference/domain/ | When business-type matters |

---

## File Conventions

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: research | decision | reference | output
status: draft | active | complete | archived
date: 2026-01-16
source: gemini | gpt | claude-code | claude-web | mining | audit  # For research
model: opus-4.5 | sonnet-3.5  # When relevant
linked_decisions: []  # For research files
---
```

### Naming

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Core reference | `slug.md` | `offer.md`, `audience.md` |
| Research | `YYYY-MM-DD-slug-[source].md` | `2026-01-16-analysis-gemini.md` |
| Decisions | `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` | `2026-01-16-angle-strategy.md` |
| Output batches | `###_TYPE_name_date.md` | `001_IMG_get-funded_2026-01-16.md` |

### Rules

1. **Frontmatter on all markdown** — type, status, date minimum
2. **Research links to decisions** via `linked_decisions: []` in frontmatter
3. **Decisions reference research** via `## Research` section
4. **Max ~500 lines per file** — split if larger
5. **Edit existing > create new**
6. **Flat > deep** — max 2 levels of folder nesting

---

## The Flow

```
RESEARCH (investigate)
    ↓
DECISIONS (choose with rationale)
    ↓
REFERENCE (update evergreen truth)
    ↓
OUTPUTS (generate via skills)
    ↓
PLATFORM (publish)
    ↓
MINE PERFORMANCE → back to RESEARCH
```
