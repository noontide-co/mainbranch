# Push Primitive, Operator Vocabulary, And Campaign Compatibility

## Decision

The canonical engine primitive is **`push`**. The operator's business
calls it whatever it wants — *drop*, *launch*, *challenge*, *promo*,
*play*, *round*, *wave*, *campaign* — and the engine speaks the
operator's word back. Storage is canonical; language is personalized.

This decision turns the operating-spine principle "operator owns the
vocabulary, engine owns the taste" into a public product contract. It
covers four answers a future agent must be able to read off without
guessing:

1. What the engine calls the primitive.
2. What lives on disk.
3. What Claude says to the operator.
4. How existing `campaigns/` records keep working.

It is decision-only. Deterministic implementation lives in
[#323](https://github.com/noontide-co/mainbranch/issues/323).
Skill / runtime / migration code lives in
[#324](https://github.com/noontide-co/mainbranch/issues/324).

## 1. Canonical Engine Primitive

| Surface | Canonical name |
| --- | --- |
| Folder | `pushes/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/push.md` |
| Frontmatter `type:` | `push` |
| Link fields on other primitives | `linked_pushes` |
| `mb status` / `mb graph` JSON keys | `pushes`, `active_pushes`, `push_count`, etc. |
| CLI command surface | `mb push new`, `mb push close`, `mb push list`, `mb push open` |
| Bounded `kind:` enum | `launch \| drop \| challenge \| promo \| nurture \| outreach \| event \| announcement \| round \| wave` |

The folder uses **day** precision (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug`) to match every
other dated primitive in the repo (`decisions/`, `research/`, `bets/`,
`log/`). The merged campaign primitive decision's example used month
precision; the canonical shape going forward is day.

`kind:` is a frontmatter field, bounded, and engine-controlled. It
describes the *shape* of the push (a launch is multi-phase; a drop is
single-shot; a nurture is sequential). It is not the operator's
display word; that belongs in operator vocabulary (§3).

## 2. Legacy `campaigns/` Compatibility — Canonical Write, Dual Read

The compatibility contract is **canonical write, dual read**.

### New writes (canonical)

`mb` writes new records as:

- folder `pushes/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/push.md`;
- frontmatter `type: push`;
- link field `linked_pushes`;
- push-shaped JSON keys.

New skills, scaffolding, fixtures, and bundled docs use this shape.

### Legacy reads (compatibility)

`mb` continues to read every committed `campaigns/<slug>/campaign.md`
record. Specifically:

- `mb validate` accepts `campaigns/*/campaign.md` against the campaign
  schema and lifecycle from
  [decisions/2026-05-06-campaign-primitive-and-architecture-model.md](2026-05-06-campaign-primitive-and-architecture-model.md).
- `mb graph` and `mb status` index `campaigns/` records.
- `type: campaign` is a recognized alias of `type: push` on read.
- `linked_campaigns` is a recognized alias of `linked_pushes` on read.
- `campaign_path` and any committed examples that name campaign-shaped
  paths continue to resolve.

There is no silent rewrite of existing private repos — every migration
is operator-initiated and preview-first (§5).

### JSON output transition is additive

For at least one minor release after this decision lands, `mb status`,
`mb graph`, and any other JSON-emitting command surface **add** push
keys (`pushes`, `active_pushes`, etc.) **alongside** legacy campaign
keys (`campaigns`, `active_campaigns`, etc.). Legacy keys carry an
explicit deprecation marker in the JSON payload (e.g. a sibling
`deprecated_campaign_keys: true` field, or the legacy keys themselves
nested under `_deprecated:`) so consumers can detect the shift without
breaking on first contact.

Removal of the legacy keys is scheduled in a future release whose
release notes name the removal target and the migration window. Until
that release ships, JSON consumers may rely on either set; they are
encouraged to migrate to the push keys at their own pace.

### Sunset

This is a compatibility contract, not a permanent dual life. Write-side
support for `campaigns/` (i.e. tolerance of new commits writing to the
legacy folder) sunsets after the migration command lands and at least
one minor release of co-existence has shipped. Read-side support stays
until the engine ships a deprecation that names a removal release.

## 3. Operator Vocabulary At `core/vocabulary.md`

The operator's preferred words live in **`core/vocabulary.md`**.
Tracked business truth in the business repo — not `.mb/`, not Claude
memory, not `CLAUDE.md`, not `core/voice.md`. The file is optional;
absent the file, the engine speaks its canonical words.

`core/voice.md` answers *how this business sounds* (cadence, register,
forbidden phrases, signature moves).
`core/vocabulary.md` answers *what this business calls operating
primitives* (the noun for a coordinated push, the synonym for a
status, the phrase for a channel).

These are two separate concerns and live in two separate files.

### Shape

Machine-readable terms live in **frontmatter**, in a bounded `terms:`
block. The body is for prose explanation only; tooling does not parse
it:

```yaml
---
type: vocabulary
status: active
terms:
  push:
    singular: drop
    plural: drops
  statuses:
    active: live
    completed: shipped
  channels:
    paid: paid traffic
    organic: content
  kinds:
    launch: launch
    drop: drop
    challenge: challenge
---

This business calls coordinated pushes "drops." Active drops are
"live"; completed drops are "shipped." See core/voice.md for tone.
```

Bounded keys only under `terms:` — `push`, `statuses`, `channels`,
`kinds`. The `push` entry takes both `singular` and `plural` because
operator-facing copy says both forms ("Your active drop" / "Two drops
in flight"). Anything outside the bounded shape is ignored or warned
by the validator. Per-key values are display words; they replace the
canonical word in operator-facing copy without changing the underlying
engine state.

### What vocabulary affects

- Skill prompts (e.g. `/mb-push new` says "want to open a drop?" when
  `terms.push.singular: drop` is set).
- `mb status` conversational output ("Your active drop: Workshop
  waitlist. Day 14.").
- Error messages aimed at operators.
- Narration drafts (the operator's word goes in published artifacts).

### What vocabulary cannot change

`core/vocabulary.md` is operator prose only. It must not rename, alias,
or otherwise redirect any of these:

- folder names (`pushes/`, `campaigns/`, `core/`, `bets/`, `decisions/`);
- frontmatter `type:` values (`push`, `campaign`, `bet`, `decision`);
- link field names (`linked_pushes`, `linked_campaigns`, `linked_bets`,
  `linked_decisions`);
- JSON output keys (`pushes`, `active_pushes`, `bets`, etc.);
- validator rules and enums (`CAMPAIGN_STATUS`, the `kind:` enum, the
  bounded vocabulary keys themselves);
- CLI command names (`mb push`, `mb status`, `mb validate`, `mb graph`,
  `mb doctor`, `mb migrate`);
- contributor documentation (AGENTS.md, command reference, troubleshooting).

The rule from the operating spine applies: canonical storage is boring
and consistent; operator-facing language is personalized and consistent.
**Folder names, frontmatter types, JSON keys, and prose labels do not
mix casually.**

### `kind:` is a canonical engine subtype, not vocabulary

`kind:` describes the *shape* of a push: a `launch` is a multi-phase
effort with pre-launch and post-launch arcs; a `drop` is a single-shot
release; a `challenge` is a time-bounded participation push. These are
engine concepts, set on `push.md` frontmatter, validated against the
bounded enum.

A business whose vocabulary maps `terms.push.singular: drop` does **not**
change `kind:`. Their multi-phase launch is still `kind: launch` on
disk and surfaces to the operator as "your launch drop" or "your
drop." The display word and the engine subtype are independent
concerns.

### Default and fallback

- No `core/vocabulary.md` → engine speaks canonical words (`push`,
  `active`, `completed`).
- Partial `core/vocabulary.md` → engine speaks operator's word where
  defined, falls back to canonical otherwise.
- Unknown keys under `terms:` → validator warns; engine ignores.
- Body content → ignored by tooling; included for human readers.

## 4. `git push` And `mb push`

The two coexist. The product command surface (`mb push <subcommand>`)
disambiguates.

- Documentation says `git push` when referring to the git operation.
- Documentation says `mb push new`, `mb push close`, etc. when referring
  to the engine command.
- Beginner and operator-facing copy that would otherwise say a bare
  "push" instead uses the operator's vocabulary word from
  `core/vocabulary.md` when one is set, or the canonical noun
  (a *push*) when none is set.
- Command reference and contributor docs may say "push" when the surface
  is unambiguous.

This is consistent with the operating-spine voice contract: avoid
unexplained internal jargon in beginner copy, but command reference
and technical material may name exact commands when precision matters.

## 5. Migration Policy

The implementation lives in #324; the **policy** lands here.

- **No silent migration.** Engine never rewrites a private repo without
  operator approval.
- **Preview before writes.** `mb doctor --include-migration` or
  `mb migrate` produces a plan and exits. The operator inspects the
  plan and re-runs with an explicit apply flag to land the moves.
- **Compatibility reads survive.** `campaigns/` records remain
  validatable and indexable for at least one minor release after the
  migration command ships.
- **One coordinated pass per repo.** The migration moves a repo from
  `campaigns/` to `pushes/`, renames `linked_campaigns` to
  `linked_pushes`, and leaves a record of the move in `log/`. It does
  not partially migrate; it does not interleave with unrelated changes.
- **Public examples and fixtures lead.** Engine-bundled fixtures and
  doc examples adopt `pushes/` first; private repos follow on the
  operator's schedule.
- **Public release notes name the deprecation.** When the engine
  schedules removal of write-side `campaigns/` support, the release
  notes say so explicitly with a version target.

## What This Decision Supersedes

This decision supersedes only the **canonical storage shape** from
[decisions/2026-05-06-campaign-primitive-and-architecture-model.md](2026-05-06-campaign-primitive-and-architecture-model.md).
That decision said the canonical primitive folder was `campaigns/`,
the frontmatter was `type: campaign`, and the link field was
`linked_campaigns`. Those are now compatibility reads. The canonical
shape is `push`.

It **does not** supersede the campaign primitive decision's other
contributions:

- The definition of a coordinated push (a named, bounded effort with
  a goal, audience, channels, timeline, and outcome) stands.
- The relationship model (*strategy → bet → offer → push → provider
  data → reflection*) stands.
- The lifecycle (`draft, planned, active, paused, completed, canceled,
  archived`) stands and is the lifecycle for `pushes/` records.
- The non-campaign artifact routing (`research/`, `documents/`,
  `log/`, etc.) stands.
- The architecture-doc work in `docs/system-architecture.md` stands;
  that doc gets a pointer to this decision and its primitive section
  updates the canonical name.

The campaigns refuse-list decision continues to apply unchanged. The
refused fields on `campaign.md` are refused on `push.md`.

## Consequences

- New business repos created after this decision lands write to
  `pushes/`. Existing repos with `campaigns/` keep validating; their
  operators choose when to migrate.
- `core/vocabulary.md` is a new optional reference file in the business
  repo. The scaffolding work to ship it (template, doctor check,
  validator schema, example) lives in #324.
- `mb status` JSON gains canonical `pushes` keys; legacy callers that
  read `campaigns` keys are supported for at least one minor release.
- Bundled skills (`/mb-ads`, `/mb-organic`, `/mb-site`, `/mb-vsl`,
  `/mb-bet`, `/mb-start`) are not rewritten in this branch. Their
  next material change adopts the canonical push surface and reads
  `core/vocabulary.md` if it exists. (Owned by #324.)
- Public docs that previously named `campaigns/` as the canonical
  primitive get updates in this branch's PR (`system-architecture.md`)
  or shortly after (README, AGENTS.md, contributor docs) as part of
  #324's coordinated pass.
- The merge into #323's deterministic engine work is unblocked: it can
  add `pushes/` schemas, dual-read campaign records, and ship the
  vocabulary validator without further architectural debate.

## Design Rule

Canonical storage is boring and consistent. Operator-facing language
is personalized and consistent. Folder names, frontmatter types, JSON
keys, and prose labels do not mix casually.

If a future PR ships `pushes/` writes while leaving `linked_campaigns`
in scaffolding, or `type: push` while skill prose still says
"campaign," that PR is incomplete and gets sent back. The migration
either moves cleanly or is held until it can.

## Sources

This decision applies the operating-spine principle that the operator
owns the vocabulary while the engine owns the taste. It draws on
common compatibility patterns from product database migrations
(canonical writes; aliased reads; preview-then-apply migrations) and
on operator-language research showing that real coaches, creators,
and community operators reach for *drop*, *launch*, *challenge*, and
*play* far more than *campaign* — while the word *campaign* already
means a Meta Ads object inside their tools.

The durable artifacts are this decision and the public docs that
will point at it.
