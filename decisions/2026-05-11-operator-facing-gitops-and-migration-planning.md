# Operator-Facing GitOps and Major Migration Planning

## Decision

Main Branch separates **deterministic facts** (CLI JSON) from **operator-facing
guidance** (skill prose) by adding three primitives to the engine and deferring
three command surfaces to follow-up issues.

Land in this slice:

1. **`audience` classification** on every finding emitted by `mb doctor`,
   `mb validate`, and `mb status` ranked actions. Values: `mechanical`,
   `operator_decision`, `informational`.
2. **`operator_summary`** plain-language one-liner on top-level findings, so a
   business owner can read the next step without parsing schema language.
3. **Workflow awareness** in `mb status` — extend the existing `git` block to
   name the workflow mode (`solo-on-main`, `branch`, `worktree`, `detached`),
   detect the default branch, and report ahead/behind counts so skills can
   route save and publish guidance without their own git wrappers.

Defer to follow-up issues, with contracts named here so future work can land
without re-litigating the design:

4. **`mb commit --plan` / `mb publish --plan`** — planned save and publish
   primitives that read the workflow mode and route to the right git operation.
5. **Packaged `/mb-publish` skill** — replaces per-session
   `.context/attachments/PR instructions` files with a bundled skill that reads
   `mb publish --plan` and walks the operator through it.
6. **`mb migrate plan` non-standard folder scanner** — extends today's
   `mb migrate` with a planner that surfaces non-standard top-level folders,
   path substitution maps, and preservation guarantees before any move.

## Why

Dogfooding a Noontide business-repo migration after v0.3.10–v0.3.15 showed two
gaps:

- `mb doctor` and `mb validate` produce useful facts, but they still speak
  schema and Git language. A business owner reads the JSON and does not know
  which findings are safe to auto-repair and which need a human call.
- Publishing changes is currently a per-session `.context/attachments/PR
  instructions` file. That is a maintainer workaround. The engine should know
  how to save and publish without a paste-in.

This decision draws a single boundary: **the CLI exposes structured facts;
runtime skills translate them into business language.** That boundary is in
`decisions/2026-05-01-mb-cli-vs-agent-workflows-boundary.md`, but the current
finding shapes do not carry enough information for skills to do that
translation without re-deriving it every time. The three primitives in this
slice give skills the routing signals they need.

The deferred surfaces (commit-plan, publish-plan, migration planner) all depend
on these primitives, so locking the primitives first lets each follow-up issue
ship in its own PR with its own validation evidence.

## Classification Taxonomy

Every finding emitted by `mb doctor`, `mb validate`, and `mb status` ranked
actions carries an `audience` field. Values are stable, additive, and small:

- **`mechanical`** — Main Branch can apply the fix safely without operator
  judgment. The repair is a renamed field, a missing mirror link, a stale
  cache, or any change with a deterministic correct answer. Today this maps to
  doctor actions with `safe_to_apply: true` and `mode: "write"`, validate
  findings with categories in the deterministic-repair set, and status actions
  whose recommended command is a `--apply`-style flag.
- **`operator_decision`** — A human must decide. The repair is a content
  change, a destructive move, a frontmatter shape that depends on what the
  operator meant, or a workflow choice. Today this maps to doctor actions with
  `safe_to_apply: false`, validate findings with operator-judgment categories
  (status enum, missing slug, missing reverse link, broken cross-ref), and
  status actions that recommend writing or editing repo files.
- **`informational`** — The finding is a signal, not a fix. Used for read-only
  checks, ranked actions that surface state without recommending mutation, and
  doctor actions with `mode: "read"`.

The existing `safe_to_apply` boolean on doctor actions stays as the safety
gate. `audience` is the routing primitive for skills and agents; it is not a
new safety mechanism.

### Mapping rules (this slice)

- `mb doctor` actions
  - `mode == "read"` → `informational`
  - `mode == "write"` and `safe_to_apply` → `mechanical`
  - `mode == "write"` and not `safe_to_apply` → `operator_decision`
- `mb validate` finding categories
  - `missing_related_link_mirror`, `migration_drift` → `mechanical`
  - `yaml_error`, `schema_shape_error`, `no_frontmatter` → `operator_decision`
    (the file is broken; a human reads and fixes)
  - `missing_slug`, `missing_required_key`, `status_enum_mismatch`,
    `enum_mismatch`, `missing_cross_ref_target`, `missing_reverse_link` →
    `operator_decision`
  - `other_error`, `other_warning` → `operator_decision`
- `mb status` ranked actions inherit `audience` from their underlying signal
  when present; otherwise they default to `operator_decision` (status's job is
  to prompt judgment, not silently repair).

These rules live in code, not docs. Skills and agents should read the
`audience` field, not re-derive from `safe_to_apply` or category names.

## Operator-Facing Summary

`operator_summary` is a plain-language one-liner on top-level findings:

- `mb doctor` actions grow an `operator_summary` field. When no explicit
  copy is supplied, it falls back to `reason` (or `title`) so the field is
  always populated.
- `mb validate` validation categories already carry a `repair` string;
  `operator_summary` is added alongside as the human-facing phrasing, and
  `repair` remains the action-oriented phrasing (the two can be the same
  string when no separate operator framing is useful).
- `mb status` ranked actions grow an `operator_summary` field built from
  their existing `reason` (with `title` as the next fallback).

The intent is plain business language with no schema field names or git
jargon. This rollout is **progressive**: in this slice, validation
categories carry the carefully written
`VALIDATION_CATEGORY_OPERATOR_SUMMARY` copy, while doctor actions and
status ranked actions fall back to the existing `reason`/`title` strings
until each callsite is updated with explicit operator-facing copy. Skills
should rely on the field being present and parseable today; they should
not yet assume every value reads as plain business language. Follow-up
work — and any future audit of doctor/ranker callsites — should pass
explicit `operator_summary=` strings where the legacy `reason` still
leaks schema or git terms.

## Workflow Awareness in `mb status`

`mb status`'s `git` block today emits:

```text
git.available, git.inside_work_tree, git.branch, git.commit,
git.dirty, git.dirty_count, git.dirty_files, git.remote, git.error
```

This slice adds, in the same block, as additive optional fields:

- **`workflow_mode`** — string, one of:
  - `solo-on-main` — current branch is the default branch and there is no
    branch-and-PR workflow expected today.
  - `branch` — current branch is not the default branch, and the repo is a
    plain clone or main worktree.
  - `worktree` — current checkout is a linked git worktree (Conductor
    workspaces, manual `git worktree add`).
  - `detached` — `HEAD` is detached. No save or publish operations should be
    proposed without operator action.
- **`default_branch`** — string, the repo's default branch when known.
  Detected via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, falling back to
  `main` and then `master` for repos without a remote.
- **`ahead`** — integer count of commits ahead of the upstream, or `null` when
  unknown (no upstream tracking).
- **`behind`** — integer count of commits behind the upstream, or `null`.
- **`upstream`** — string name of the upstream ref, or empty.
- **`worktree_root`** — absolute path of the worktree root when `workflow` is
  `worktree`; empty otherwise.
- **`summary`** — short operator-facing one-liner describing the workflow
  state. The implementation emits forms like
  `"On main with no uncommitted changes."`,
  `"On branch \`feature/x\` with 3 uncommitted files ahead by 2."`,
  `"In a worktree on \`feature/x\` with 1 uncommitted file."`,
  and `"HEAD is detached. Check out a branch before saving."`. The exact
  wording lives in `_build_git_summary` in `mb/mb/status.py`; this doc
  describes the contract, not the surface phrasing.

All additions are additive. `STATUS_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at `"1.0"`. Consumers
that do not read the new fields keep working.

### Boundary: what `workflow_mode` does and does not describe

`workflow_mode` describes the local git checkout shape for an **existing**
repo. It does **not** describe:

- **Pre-repo setup state.** `/mb-setup`, `mb init`, and `mb onboard` can run
  before `.git` exists, before an `origin` remote is set, or before the
  remote has established a default branch. Those states are not workflow
  modes; they are setup states and live under the setup/onboard surface.
- **Actor permissions.** An external contributor with no push access looks
  identical to an owner working on a feature branch locally. `workflow_mode`
  is about the local git shape; the actor's GitHub permission role (owner,
  member, contributor, viewer) is a separate axis and belongs to publish
  and checks-model work, not here.
- **Where the repo lives.** Local-only vs personal GitHub vs free GitHub org
  vs paid org vs self-hosted Git (Forgejo/Gitea) is a setup-rubric question
  for `/mb-setup` and `docs/DEPENDENCY-CHOICES.md`. `workflow_mode` is read
  from the repo that already exists; it does not recommend where the next
  repo should be created.
- **Checks and review enforcement.** Whether a check is required, whether
  it runs in GitHub Actions, and whether branch protection gates merges are
  questions for a separate checks-and-review-model decision. `workflow_mode`
  is local shape only.

These boundaries are recorded here so the deferred surfaces below do not
have to rediscover them.

## Deferred Surfaces (Contracts Locked Here, Implementation in Follow-Ups)

### `mb commit --plan` / `mb publish --plan`

A planned save and publish layer that reads `git.workflow_mode` and routes:

- `solo-on-main` and `worktree` → `mb commit --plan` produces concern-clustered
  commit groups (using `mb checkpoint --plan` machinery) and recommends
  `git push` when the operator confirms.
- `branch` and `worktree` with a non-default branch → `mb publish --plan`
  produces the commit groups plus a PR plan: title, body skeleton built from
  the branch's commit log, closing-issues parsed from commit messages, base
  branch, and the `gh pr create` command the operator can run.

`mb publish --plan` will surface `actor_role` and `publish_path` (for example
`direct_push` vs `pull_request`) as distinct axes from `workflow_mode`, so a
`branch` workflow without push access can plan a fork-and-PR path rather than
failing at push time. The exact shape of those axes — including whether and
how `mb publish --plan` reads required-status-check state, GitHub branch
protection, or org membership — belongs to a separate decision on the
checks-and-review model for business repos, not this one.

Both commands emit structured JSON with the same shape as `mb checkpoint
--plan` today, plus a top-level `audience` and `operator_summary`. They write
nothing without `--yes`. They are read-only by default.

Follow-up issue: track separately. Validation evidence required: fixture repo
covering each workflow mode, plus a CLI smoke that exercises plan-only.

### Packaged `/mb-publish` skill

Replaces the per-session `.context/attachments/PR instructions` files. The
skill calls `mb publish --plan --json`, renders the plan in business language,
asks the operator to confirm, and shells out to `git push` and `gh pr create`.
The skill never reimplements PR-body generation; it reads the plan.

Follow-up issue: track separately. Validation: runtime smoke from a fresh
business repo on a feature branch.

### `mb migrate plan`

Extends today's `mb migrate` with a planner mode that scans non-standard
top-level folders (`outputs/`, `reference/`, `briefs/`, `content/`, `staging/`,
`skills/`, `ops/`, and any custom folder not covered by the topology map),
produces a path substitution map showing where each tree would land in the
current topology, preserves git history via `git mv`, and refuses to apply
ambiguous moves without operator confirmation. Each move carries an
`audience` field (`mechanical` for a topology-recognized rename;
`operator_decision` for an ambiguous move).

Follow-up issue: track separately. Validation: fixture repo with at least one
non-standard folder and a snapshot test of the plan output.

## Out of Scope (Belongs to Other Decisions)

Two adjacent product questions came up while scoping this work. They are
explicitly **not** this decision's job. Naming them here so a future agent
does not try to resolve them inside the operator-facing GitOps surface.

### Repo home and GitHub org setup rubric

Where a business repo should live — local-only, personal GitHub, free
GitHub organization, paid GitHub Team, or self-hosted Git such as
Forgejo/Gitea — is a setup-rubric question. It belongs to `/mb-setup` and
`docs/DEPENDENCY-CHOICES.md`, not here. GitHub organizations can be free;
paid plans are optional and only needed for advanced team controls,
support, or higher private-repo collaboration limits. Setup guidance
should default to "personal GitHub or free GitHub org" and avoid
implying a paywall.

`workflow_mode` reads the local git shape of a repo that already exists.
It does not recommend where the next repo should be created.

### Checks and review model for business repos

What runs locally vs in GitHub Actions, which checks are required vs
informational vs warnings, whether branch protection gates merges, and
how `mb publish --plan` should read GitHub check or required-status-check
state is a separate product decision. The split is roughly:

- `mb` defines and runs the rules locally;
- agents use `mb` output to explain and repair;
- GitHub Actions can run the same rules on PRs when the repo lives on
  GitHub;
- GitHub branch protection is optional for solo users, recommended for
  team/org repos;
- dashboards and Obsidian display state, they do not own enforcement.

That model deserves its own decision and is out of scope here. The
`audience` taxonomy (`mechanical`, `operator_decision`, `informational`)
is reusable by that future decision; this slice should not pre-bake the
enforcement rules.

## Consequences

- `mb status`, `mb doctor`, and `mb validate` JSON gains additive fields.
  Tests assert presence and shape; tests do not assert absence of other fields,
  to keep this slice composable with future work.
- Skills can route on `audience` and render `operator_summary` without their
  own git wrappers or schema-to-prose translation.
- Future work (`mb commit --plan`, `mb publish --plan`, `/mb-publish`,
  `mb migrate plan`) lands in its own issue and PR. Each one cites this
  decision as the contract.
- Per-session `.context/attachments/PR instructions` files become unnecessary
  once `/mb-publish` ships. Until then, they remain a maintainer-only
  workaround and should not be referenced from public docs.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` v0.3 line gains a sub-bullet for this work; the deferred
  surfaces land under v0.3 or v0.4 depending on sequencing.

## Review Trigger

Revisit if any of these turn out to be wrong:

- A finding category needs a fourth `audience` value (for example, a "blocked"
  state where the system cannot classify safety). If so, extend the enum;
  do not silently expand existing values.
- The workflow detection logic misclassifies a real repo Devon or a public
  contributor uses. Update the detection rules in `mb/mb/status.py` and the
  fixture set.
- A skill needs information the `operator_summary` field cannot carry. Add a
  second field (`operator_explanation`?) rather than overloading
  `operator_summary`.
