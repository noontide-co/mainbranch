# Main Branch System Model

Main Branch has three user-visible pieces:

- **Your business folder** -- the place Claude reads and writes durable
  business memory: offer, audience, voice, proof, research, decisions, bets,
  pushes, logs, and outcomes.
- **The `mb` CLI** -- the deterministic control plane. It checks setup,
  status, validation, graph links, provider readiness, updates, repairs, and
  checkpoints.
- **The skills** -- the judgment layer Claude uses for routing, writing,
  review, and explanation.

Normal operators should not need to think in terms of a package or source
checkout. They open the business folder, start Claude Code, and run
`/mb-start`. The CLI and skills do the setup and repair work underneath.

## How The Pieces Work

```text
business folder
├── core/                 # offer, audience, voice, proof, strategy
├── research/             # source notes and investigations
├── decisions/            # choices the business made
├── bets/                 # time-boxed operating hypotheses
├── pushes/               # coordinated shipping work
├── log/                  # what happened
├── .mb/                  # local Main Branch state
└── .claude/skills/mb-*   # Claude Code skill discovery links
```

`mb onboard` or `/mb-setup` creates and repairs this wiring. `mb update` keeps
the installed Main Branch package and skill links current. `/mb-start` reads
the folder through CLI facts before routing the operator into a workflow.

## Where Files Live

| Content | Location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Offer, audience, voice, proof | Business folder | Business-specific durable truth |
| Research, decisions, bets, pushes, logs | Business folder | Operating memory the next session can read |
| Local setup state | `.mb/` | Repairable machine-local state |
| Claude Code skill links | `.claude/skills/mb-*` | Runtime discovery |
| Main Branch implementation | Installed package or source checkout | Shared software, not business memory |

If the operator asks where to edit, point them to the business folder. If they
ask how to repair, route to `/mb-start`, `/mb-setup`, `/mb-update`, or the
underlying `mb` command named by status or doctor output.

For old clone-era installs, stale skill links, or `reference/core/` layouts,
use `docs/migrating.md` as the source of truth. Normal help should teach the
current business-folder, CLI, and skills model. Migration is readiness work:
current skills depend on `mb` CLI facts, so old wiring and reported repair
errors should be fixed before serious skill use.
