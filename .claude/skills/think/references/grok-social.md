## CRITICAL: API Limitations

**The REST API does not support X search. You must use the Python SDK with grok-4.** See [grok-setup.md](grok-setup.md) for the full REST vs SDK explanation and setup instructions.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "what are people saying about..."
- "sentiment on X about..."
- "what's trending in..."
- "social proof for..."
- "X/Twitter research on..."
- "real-time opinions about..."

**Best for:**
- Understanding current sentiment around a topic
- Finding social proof and real opinions
- Researching what your audience actually talks about
- Trend discovery in your niche
- Competitive intelligence (what are people saying about competitors?)

**Not for:**
- Historical research (use Gemini/web search)
- Deep technical research (use Gemini)
- Content that lives in articles/blogs (use web search)

---

## Quick Start

**Three approaches, in order of preference:**

1. **Python SDK** (full X search) → Requires `xai_sdk` package
2. **Grok X Insights MCP** (community wrapper) → See [grok-setup.md](grok-setup.md)
3. **Fallback: WebSearch** → `site:x.com [query]` (less structured)

---

## Option 1: Python SDK (Recommended for X Search)

The official xAI Python SDK uses gRPC and supports X search tools that execute server-side.

### Setup

```bash
pip install xai-sdk
export XAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### How X Search Works

X search is **tool-based**. You don't call search directly — you give the model access to search tools and it decides when to use them:

```python
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.tools import x_search
from xai_sdk.chat import user

client = Client()

chat = client.chat.create(
    model="grok-4",  # grok-4 required for server-side x_search tools
    tools=[x_search()],
)

chat.append(user("What are people saying about AI coding assistants on X?"))

response = chat.sample()
print(response.content)
```

### Available Sub-Tools

When you pass `x_search()`, the model gets access to:

| Sub-Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `x_user_search` | Find X user accounts |
| `x_keyword_search` | Keyword-based post search |
| `x_semantic_search` | Semantic/contextual search |
| `x_thread_fetch` | Fetch full thread from a post |

### Search Parameters

The model can use these internally when searching:

- **Date filtering:** `from_date`, `to_date` (ISO8601 format: "2026-01-01")
- **Handle exclusion:** `excluded_handles` (list of handles to skip)
- **Result limits:** Typically returns 10-20 relevant posts

**Note:** You don't control these directly — the model decides based on your prompt. You can influence by being specific: "What have people said about X in the last week, excluding @spamaccount?"

### Example with Streaming

```python
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.tools import x_search
from xai_sdk.chat import user

def research_topic(topic: str):
    client = Client()

    chat = client.chat.create(
        model="grok-4",
        tools=[x_search()],
    )

    prompt = f"""Research what people on X are saying about: {topic}

    Provide:
    1. Overall sentiment (positive/negative/mixed)
    2. Key themes (3-5 bullet points)
    3. Notable quotes from actual posts
    4. Any controversies or debates"""

    chat.append(user(prompt))

    result = []
    for response, chunk in chat.stream():
        if chunk.token:
            result.append(chunk.token)
            print(chunk.token, end="", flush=True)

    return "".join(result)

research_topic("Skool communities")
```

## Option 2: Grok X Insights MCP (Community Wrapper)

A third-party MCP server that wraps Grok API. May or may not support live X search depending on implementation.

See [grok-setup.md](grok-setup.md) for setup.

### Tools (if MCP available)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `grok_search_posts` | Search and analyze X posts |
| `grok_analyze_topic` | Deep analysis with aspects |
| `grok_get_trends` | Trending topics |
| `grok_chat` | General chat |

**Warning:** Test if your MCP implementation actually returns X data. Check for `num_sources_used > 0` in responses.

---

## Option 3: WebSearch Fallback

When Python SDK isn't available, use WebSearch with site restriction:

```
WebSearch: "AI coding assistants site:x.com"
```

**Limitations:**
- Not real-time (indexed pages only)
- No sentiment analysis
- No structured data
- Can't see replies/threads easily

Still useful for finding popular/viral posts that have been indexed.

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sentiment Check (Python SDK)

User: "What are people saying about Skool?"

```python
prompt = """Search X for recent posts about Skool communities.
Analyze:
1. Overall sentiment (positive/negative/mixed)
2. Common themes in what people say
3. Include actual quotes from posts
4. Any common complaints or praises"""

# Save to: research/YYYY-MM-DD-skool-sentiment-x-social.md
```

### Pattern 2: Competitive Intelligence

User: "What do people say about [competitor] vs us?"

```python
prompt = """Research X posts comparing [our brand] vs [competitor].
Look for:
1. What people love about each
2. Common complaints about each
3. Feature comparisons people mention
4. Price/value discussions"""

# Save to: research/YYYY-MM-DD-competitive-x-social.md
```

### Pattern 3: Social Proof Mining

User: "Find social proof about [topic] for my messaging"

```python
prompt = """Find posts where people describe their experience with [topic].
I need:
1. Actual quotes I can use (with attribution)
2. The language/words real people use
3. Before/after stories
4. Common objections mentioned"""

# Save quotes and patterns to research/
# Consider codifying strong angles to reference/proof/angles/
```

### Pattern 4: Fallback (WebSearch)

When Python SDK unavailable:

```
1. WebSearch: "[topic] site:x.com"
2. WebFetch on promising URLs
3. Manual synthesis of findings
4. Note: "Source: WebSearch (not real-time)"
5. Save to: research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-web.md
```

## Output Format

Save X/Twitter research to: `research/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-x-social.md`

**Template:**

```markdown
---
type: research
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source: grok-x-social
status: complete
topics: [topic1, topic2]
linked_decisions: []

## Cost & Token Management

**xAI API Pricing (as of 2026):**

| Model | Input | Output | X Search |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| grok-4 | ~$3/M tokens | ~$15/M tokens | YES |
| grok-3 | ~$3/M tokens | ~$15/M tokens | NO (server-side tools removed) |
| grok-3-fast | ~$1/M tokens | ~$5/M tokens | NO |

**Typical costs per X search query:**

| Operation | Approx Tokens | Approx Cost |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Simple sentiment search | ~5-10K total | ~$0.02-0.10 |
| Deep topic analysis | ~15-20K total | ~$0.10-0.30 |
| Multi-turn conversation | ~30K+ total | ~$0.30+ |

**Cost management tips:**

1. **Be specific:** "Skool pricing complaints" vs just "Skool"
2. **Limit scope:** "last 7 days" vs "all time"
3. **Single turn:** Get what you need in one prompt
4. **Use grok-4** — currently the only model supporting x_search server-side tools

---

## Combining with Other Research

**Grok + Gemini workflow:**

1. **Grok first:** What are people saying RIGHT NOW?
2. **Gemini second:** Deep research on the patterns you found
3. **Synthesize:** Combine real-time sentiment with structured research

**Example:**
> "Research email list transition strategies"
> 1. Grok: "What are people saying about email list rebrands?" (real sentiment)
> 2. Gemini: "Best practices for email list transitions" (structured research)
> 3. Combine into comprehensive research file

---

## Fallback Strategy

**When Python SDK isn't available:**

| Approach | Quality | Effort |
|----------|---------|--------|
| WebSearch `site:x.com` | Medium | Low |
| Manual X search + paste | High | High |
| Skip X research | N/A | None |

**WebSearch fallback example:**
```
WebSearch: "Skool community reviews site:x.com"
WebSearch: "Skool vs Circle site:x.com"
```

**Don't block research** just because live X search isn't available — adapt and continue.

## Technical Details

### Why REST API Doesn't Work for X Search

The xAI REST API at `api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions` accepts a `search` parameter, but testing shows:

```json
// Request
{
  "model": "grok-3",
  "search": true,
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are people saying about X?"}]
}

// Response shows
{
  "num_sources_used": 0,  // <-- No X data fetched
  ...
}
```

The model responds with general knowledge, not live X data.

### Why Python SDK Works

The Python SDK (`xai_sdk`) uses:
- **gRPC** (not REST) for communication
- **Server-side tool execution** — model calls search tools that run on xAI's infrastructure
- **Tool injection** — you pass `x_search()` and model autonomously decides when to search

This is fundamentally different from REST API — the search executes server-side where xAI has X data access.
