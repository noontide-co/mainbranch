## Critical Distinction: UI vs Standard API vs Interactions API

There are THREE different things, often confused:

| Feature | Gemini UI "Deep Research" | Standard API (generate_content) | Interactions API (Deep Research Agent) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| What happens | Multi-step agentic workflow | Single model call | Multi-step agentic workflow |
| Time | 5-20 minutes | 30-60 seconds | 5-20 minutes |
| Searches | 80-160+ sources | None (unless grounding enabled) | 80-160+ sources |
| Output | Detailed report with citations | Standard response | Detailed report with citations |
| Cost | Included in Gemini subscription | ~$0.01-0.05 per query | ~$2-5 per task |
| API Access | No | Yes (`generate_content`) | Yes (`interactions.create`) |

**Key insight:** The UI "Deep Research" checkbox and the API Deep Research Agent are now the **same underlying technology**. As of late 2025, you can replicate the full Deep Research experience programmatically via the Interactions API.

## Three Research Tiers

### Tier 1: Quick Research (30-60 seconds)
**When:** Simple questions, fact-checking, quick lookups

**Use:** Standard `generate_content` API with Flash or Pro models
- `gemini-3-flash` — $0.50/$3.00 per 1M tokens (fastest, best value)
- `gemini-2.5-flash` — $0.30/$2.50 per 1M tokens (cheaper, still fast)
- Optional: Enable Google Search grounding for current info
- Typical query cost: ~$0.005-0.02

**Note:** This is NOT "Deep Research" — it's a standard model call.

### Tier 2: Deep Research (5-20 minutes)
**When:** Complex questions requiring multi-source synthesis

**Use:** Deep Research Agent via Interactions API
- Agent: `deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025`
- Powered by: Gemini 3 Pro (most capable model)
- Autonomous: plans, searches 80-160+ queries, reads, synthesizes, iterates
- Produces detailed reports with citations

**Cost breakdown:**
- Standard task: ~$2-3 (80 searches, 250K tokens)
- Complex task: ~$3-5 (160 searches, 900K tokens)
- Pricing based on Gemini 3 Pro rates: $2.00/$12.00 per 1M tokens

### Tier 3: Manual Deep Dive (Variable)
**When:** Specific sources needed, API unavailable, or cost-sensitive

**Use:** WebSearch + Apify + manual synthesis by Claude
- Full control over sources
- Can combine with transcripts, PDFs, specific URLs
- Requires more orchestration

## Interactions API: Deep Research

### SDK Requirements

```bash
# Python — use google-genai (NOT google-generativeai)
pip install google-genai>=1.55.0

# JavaScript
npm install @google/genai>=1.33.0
```

Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from Google AI Studio.

### API Endpoint

```
POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions
```

### Basic Usage (Python)

```python
import time
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

# Start Deep Research (runs asynchronously)
interaction = client.interactions.create(
    input="Research the competitive landscape for AI-powered research tools.",
    agent='deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025',
    background=True,  # Required for Deep Research
    store=True        # Required when using background=True
)

print(f"Research started: {interaction.id}")

# Poll for results (typically 5-20 minutes)
while True:
    interaction = client.interactions.get(interaction.id)
    if interaction.status == "completed":
        print(interaction.outputs[-1].text)
        break
    elif interaction.status == "failed":
        print(f"Research failed: {interaction.error}")
        break
    time.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

### With Streaming (Real-time Progress)

```python
interaction = client.interactions.create(
    input="Research topic...",
    agent='deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025',
    background=True,
    stream=True,
    agent_config={"thinking_summaries": "auto"}  # Shows reasoning progress
)

for update in interaction:
    if update.thinking_summary:
        print(f"Thinking: {update.thinking_summary}")
```

### Follow-up Questions

```python
# Initial research
first = client.interactions.create(
    input="Research AI research tools",
    agent='deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025',
    background=True, store=True
)
# ... wait for completion ...

# Follow-up (uses previous context)
followup = client.interactions.create(
    input="Now compare the top 3 in terms of pricing",
    previous_interaction_id=first.id,  # Links to previous research
    model='gemini-3-pro-preview'        # Can use model for quick follow-ups
)
```

## Cost Comparison (January 2026 Pricing)

### Tier 1: Standard API Calls

| Model | Input (per 1M) | Output (per 1M) | Typical Query | Use Case |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Gemini 3 Flash | $0.50 | $3.00 | ~$0.01 | Fast, most tasks |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | $2.50 | ~$0.005 | Budget-conscious |
| Gemini 3 Pro | $2.00 (<=200K), $4.00 (>200K) | $12.00 (<=200K), $18.00 (>200K) | ~$0.05 | Complex reasoning |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 (<=200K), $2.50 (>200K) | $10.00 (<=200K), $15.00 (>200K) | ~$0.04 | Mid-tier option |

**Batch pricing:** 50% discount on all models.
**Context caching:** Reduces repeat content cost by up to 90%.

### Tier 2: Deep Research Agent

| Task Complexity | Searches | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Est. Cost |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Standard | ~80 | ~250K (50-70% cached) | ~60K | $2-3 |
| Complex | ~160 | ~900K (50-70% cached) | ~80K | $3-5 |

**All Deep Research charged at Gemini 3 Pro rates.** Caching significantly reduces costs for repeated content.

### Tier 3: Manual Synthesis

Variable — typically $0.20-1.00 depending on:
- Number of WebSearch calls
- Apify scraping costs
- Claude synthesis tokens

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Tier 1 for 80% of queries** — Flash handles most questions well
2. **Reserve Tier 2 for complex synthesis** — competitive analysis, industry research
3. **Enable caching** for repeated prompts/system instructions
4. **Batch processing** for non-urgent workloads (50% discount)

## Workflow from /think

### For Tier 1 (Quick)

```
1. Detect simple research question
2. Use WebSearch or Flash with grounding
3. Synthesize response
4. Save to: research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-web.md or -flash.md
```

### For Tier 2 (Deep Research Agent)

```
1. Detect complex research need
2. Check: Is GOOGLE_API_KEY set?
   ├─> If no: "Deep research requires Gemini. Set up now (3 min)?"
   └─> If yes: Continue
3. Start Deep Research via Interactions API
4. Notify user: "Research started. This takes 5-20 minutes."
5. Poll for completion (or use streaming for updates)
6. Extract findings, don't dump raw
7. Save to: research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-gemini-deep.md
8. Checkpoint: "Ready to decide, or need more research?"
```

### Important: Async Handling

Deep Research takes 5-20 minutes. Options:
1. **Wait:** Poll in background, update user on progress
2. **Continue:** Let user do other work, notify when complete
3. **Stream:** Show reasoning progress in real-time

## Can We Replicate UI Deep Research via API?

**Yes, fully.** The Interactions API with `deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025` agent provides the **exact same technology** that powers the UI "Deep Research" checkbox.

| Capability | UI | API |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Multi-step planning | Yes | Yes |
| 80-160+ web searches | Yes | Yes |
| Autonomous iteration | Yes | Yes |
| Cited reports | Yes | Yes |
| Progress visibility | Yes | Yes (with streaming) |
| Follow-up questions | Yes | Yes (previous_interaction_id) |
| File/document analysis | Yes | Yes (File Search tool) |

**What's different:**
- API requires polling/streaming (not instant UI updates)
- API charges per-token (UI included in subscription)
- API is in preview (may have schema changes)
- API allows programmatic integration

**Practical recommendation:**
- **Tier 1 (Flash)** handles 80% of research needs — fast and cheap
- **Tier 2 (Deep Research Agent)** for comprehensive multi-source synthesis — use sparingly
- **Tier 3 (Manual)** when you need specific source control or cost sensitivity

---

## Fallback Options

If Deep Research API unavailable or too expensive:

1. **WebSearch multi-query:** Run 5-10 targeted searches, synthesize manually
2. **Apify RAG Browser:** Good middle ground, scrapes and processes pages
3. **Flash with grounding:** Enable Google Search, get decent synthesis
4. **Manual orchestration:** Combine multiple tools, Claude synthesizes

Don't block research just because Deep Research isn't available — adapt and continue.
