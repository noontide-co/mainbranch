description: "Main entry point for Main Branch. Detects state and routes to the right skill. Use when: user says start/help/begin, is new/returning/lost, opens vip without a task, or needs triage. Routes to /setup, /think, /ads, /vsl, /organic, /wiki, /help."
---

# Start

Single entry point for Main Branch. Detect user state, context level, experience — route to the right skill.

**Recommended workflow:** Always start Claude in vip, run `/start`. It handles everything.

---

## CRITICAL: Always Ask Which Repo

**Even if config exists with a saved default, ALWAYS ask the user which repo before proceeding.** List ALL validated repos from `recent_repos`, not just the default:

> "Found your repos:
>
> 1. [default-repo-name] (saved default)
> 2. [other-repo-name]
> 3. Switch to different repo
>
> (hit a number)"

**If only one repo in config:**

> "Found your saved repo:
>
> 1. [saved-repo-name] (saved)
> 2. Switch to different repo
>
> (hit a number)"

**DO NOT skip this question.** Users have multiple repos. The saved default is a suggestion, not automatic.

**Only exception:** User explicitly ran `/start [repo-name]` with a specific path.

**After user selects a repo:** If the selected repo is not the current `default_repo`, ask: "Want me to save [repo-name] as your default? (faster startup next time)" If yes, update `default_repo` in `~/.config/vip/local.yaml`.

---

## Numbered Options Pattern

Always use numbered lists for multi-choice. User replies with just a number.

Apply to: business repo selection, skill routing, any multiple choice.

## Step -1: Pull Updates

Run `git pull origin main` on vip silently. Mention only if updates pulled. Don't block on network issues.

```bash
# Pull vip updates (checks common locations)
for d in . ~/Documents/GitHub/vip ~/vip; do [ -d "$d/.claude/skills" ] && git -C "$d" pull origin main 2>/dev/null && break; done || true
```

---

## Step 0: Load Config and Find Business Repo

### Config Reading Flow

```
1. Read ~/.config/vip/local.yaml
   ├── Found? → Get default_repo + recent_repos + user identity
   │            Validate ALL paths (see Path Validation below)
   │            ├── All valid? → Present valid options
   │            ├── Some invalid? → Attempt recovery, prune dead paths
   │            └── All invalid? → Clear config, fall to discovery
   └── Missing? → Fall to discovery

2. If repo found, read [repo]/.vip/config.yaml
   ├── Found? → Get team settings, MCP requirements
   └── Missing? → Use defaults, offer to create later
```

### Path Validation (Before Presenting Options)

**Validate EVERY path in config before showing it to the user.** Never present a dead path as an option. For each path in `default_repo` and `recent_repos`, check `test -d "[path]/reference/core"`. If invalid, attempt recovery (check sibling folders for a renamed repo) and auto-prune dead entries. See [config-system.md](references/config-system.md) for the full recovery algorithm.

### CRITICAL: Always Offer Switch Option

**Even with valid config, ALWAYS list ALL validated repos from `recent_repos` as numbered options** (see top-level "Always Ask Which Repo" section for templates). Never show just the default — users switch repos and shouldn't have to type paths.

**Why:** Users may have multiple business repos. The saved default is a convenience, not a lock-in. Skipping this question traps users in one repo.

**Only skip the question if:** User explicitly said `/start [repo-name]` with a specific repo.

**Shortcut:** If user says `/start [repo-name]` or mentions a specific repo, validate that path directly with Read. If valid, confirm with user and proceed.

**Config path (fast):** Check `~/.config/vip/local.yaml` for `default_repo` and `user.*`. See [config-system.md](references/config-system.md).

**Why Glob fails:** User may have added subdirectories (like `decisions/` or `research/`) as additional working directories, not the parent repo. Glob from vip can't traverse up to find `reference/core/`.

**Discovery algorithm (when no config):**

1. **Extract parent paths from additional working directories**
   - Look at env info for "Additional working directories"
   - For each path, walk up to find a folder containing `reference/core/`
   - Example: if `main-branch/decisions` is listed, check `main-branch/reference/core/`

2. **Use bash to find repos** (if step 1 fails)
   ```bash
   find ~/Documents/GitHub -maxdepth 3 -type d -name "reference" -exec test -d "{}/core" \; -print 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Ask the user** (if nothing found)

**Verify with Read, not Glob:** Once you have a candidate path, use `Read` on `[path]/reference/core/soul.md` to confirm it's a business repo. (Don't check `core/offer.md` — in multi-offer repos, the primary offer details live in `offers/[name]/offer.md` instead. `soul.md` is always in `core/`.)

**Skip vip** — any path containing `.claude/skills/` is the engine, not a business repo.

**ALWAYS present numbered options** — even with ONE repo found:

> "I found this business repo:
>
> 1. [repo-name]
> 2. Another one (tell me the path)
> 3. Create new (`/setup`)
> 4. I'm confused (`/help`)
>
> Which one? (hit a number)"

**MULTIPLE found:** List all, then options 2-4 above.

**NONE found:** Ask user for path, or route to `/setup`.

### After User Selects Repo

**Offer to save to config:**

> "Want me to save [repo-name] as your default? (faster startup next time)"

If yes, update `~/.config/vip/local.yaml`:

```yaml
default_repo: /full/path/to/repo
recent_repos:
  - /full/path/to/repo
user:
  name: "[ask if not set]"
  experience: "[ask if not set]"  # beginner | intermediate | advanced
```

**If user.name or user.experience missing:** Ask once, save for future sessions.

---

## Step 0.5: Pull Business Repo Updates

Once business repo is confirmed, pull its latest updates:

```bash
cd [repo-path] && git pull origin main 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Why both repos:**
- Engine (vip) → new skills, playbooks, compliance frameworks
- Business repo → your reference files, decisions, research

If you work across machines or collaborate, your business repo may have changes. Pull them.

**Mention only if updates:** "Pulled latest updates for [repo-name]" — otherwise stay silent.

---

## Step 0.75: MCP Pre-Flight (Not Research Tools)

Check for MCPs required by skills user might invoke. See [mcp-preflight.md](references/mcp-preflight.md).

**Research tool detection happens in /think** — deferred to when user actually needs research. This keeps /start fast and avoids checking tools user might not use this session.

**What /start DOES check:**
- MCPs that skills depend on (Apify for /organic, etc.)
- Critical blockers (missing config, broken paths)

**What /start DOES NOT check:**
- Research tools (Gemini, Grok, whisper, etc.) — /think handles these
- Document tools (markitdown, pandoc, marker) — /think handles these

**Why defer:** Most sessions don't use all tools. Checking everything upfront wastes time and clutters the greeting. /think detects tools when user's intent requires them and surfaces setup options at the right moment.

If user's stated intent involves research, route to /think — it will handle tool detection with config-first logic (reads `.vip/config.yaml`, only probes unknowns, updates config with results).

---

## Step 0.9: Readiness Assessment

**Run AFTER MCP pre-flight, BEFORE routing.** Scores reference files, checks session state, and gates routing so users don't jump into output skills with thin context.

See [readiness-assessment.md](references/readiness-assessment.md) for complete scoring rubric, session state checks, soul health check, skill-specific requirements, and display format.

### Quick summary:

1. **Score reference files** (soul, offer, audience, voice, testimonials, angles) on 0-3 scale each. Composite max = 18. Multi-offer: score active offer's files, not just core.
2. **Check session state** — recent commits, open decisions, uncodified research. Surface what's in progress.
3. **Soul health check** — for returning users (last commit >3 days ago), read soul.md and ask: "Is your current work feeling like pull or push?" Skip for active or first-time users.
4. **Gate routing** based on composite score:

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0-3 | EMPTY | Route to `/setup` |
| 4-7 | MINIMAL | Block output skills, route to `/think` |
| 8-11 | THIN | Warn before output skills, suggest `/think` first |
| 12-14 | GOOD | All skills, note gaps |
| 15-18 | FULL | All skills available |

Adapt display to `user.experience` level (beginner = full breakdown, advanced = score only). See reference file for details.

---

## Step 1: Load Business Context

Read these files (in order) to prep Claude:

```
[repo]/CLAUDE.md                    - Business brain
[repo]/reference/core/soul.md       - WHY (philosophy, beliefs)
[repo]/reference/core/offer.md      - WHAT (product, pricing)
[repo]/reference/core/audience.md   - WHO (pains, desires)
[repo]/reference/core/voice.md      - HOW (tone, vocabulary)
```

**Missing files?** Skip silently. If 2+ core files missing → `/think codify`.

**Multi-offer context:** If `current_offer` is set (see Step 1.5), also load `reference/offers/[current_offer]/offer.md`. This is the active offer — it takes precedence over `core/offer.md` for offer-specific details. `core/offer.md` becomes the brand-level thesis. If `offers/[current_offer]/audience.md` exists, load it too (offer-specific audience override).

---

## Step 1.5: Offer Detection (Multi-Offer Only)

After loading core context, check for multi-offer:

```bash
ls reference/offers/*/offer.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If no offers/ folder:** Single-offer mode. Skip to Step 2. Everything reads from `core/`.

**If offers/ found:** Multi-offer mode.
1. Check `.vip/local.yaml` for `current_offer`
2. If set: Confirm — "Working on **[offer]**. Continue? (y / type offer name to switch)"
3. If not set: Present numbered list of offers + "all (brand-level work)"
4. Write selection to `.vip/local.yaml`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .vip && echo "current_offer: [name]" > .vip/local.yaml
   ```

**Shortcut:** `/start [offer-name]` sets `current_offer` directly and skips the selection prompt. If the argument matches an offer folder name, write it to `.vip/local.yaml` and confirm: "Locked to **[offer-name]**."

**"all" selection:** When user picks "all" or "brand-level work", set `current_offer: null` in `.vip/local.yaml`. Skills will read from `core/` only — appropriate for brand-level thinking, content strategy, and soul/voice work.

---

## Step 2: Detect State and Assess Completeness

Check `reference/core/*.md`. No folder → `/setup`. Exists → check completeness:

| File | Complete If |
|------|------------|
| soul.md | >30 lines or "Beliefs" section |
| offer.md | >50 lines or "Price" section |
| audience.md | >30 lines or "Pains" section |
| voice.md | >20 lines or "Tone" section |

2+ empty/missing → `/think codify`. Complete → route by intent.

**Multi-offer completeness:** When `offers/` exists, also check the active offer's `offer.md` for substance. A thin offer file (< 20 lines) means `/think` should be recommended to flesh it out. Don't count brand-level `core/offer.md` as a substitute for a missing offer-specific file.

---

## Step 3: Route by Intent

**Respect readiness gates from Step 0.9.** If status is MINIMAL or EMPTY, do not offer output skills. If THIN, warn. See [readiness-assessment.md](references/readiness-assessment.md) for skill-specific requirements.

**Show context:** Before presenting options, show: "Business: **[repo name]** | Offer: **[current_offer or 'single']**"

If user is ready to work, ask or infer intent. **Use numbered options:**

### Option 0 Gating (Triage)

**Do NOT offer option 0 when ANY of these are true:**
- Context window is >60% full (triage is token-expensive)
- User stated clear intent (they already know what they want)
- Readiness is EMPTY or MINIMAL (0-7) — the answer is obvious: route to `/setup` or `/think`

**When option 0 is gated out**, show options 1-8 only (renumber starting at 1). When option 0 IS available, show the full list starting at 0.

**Auto-suggest (but don't auto-run) option 0 when:**
- User is returning after 3+ days (soul health check context)
- Readiness is THIN-to-GOOD (8-14) — enough to analyze, enough gaps to fill
- Soul health check indicated "push" (suggests drift)

### Options List (with option 0)

> "Your reference files look good. What would you like to do?
>
> 0. Help me figure out what to work on → deep analysis (see [triage-agent.md](references/triage-agent.md))
> 1. Enrich the core (research, decide, codify) → `/think`
> 2. Create ads (image or video) → `/ads`
> 3. Write a VSL script → `/vsl`
> 4. Create organic content → `/organic`
> 5. Write a newsletter → `/newsletter` (coming soon — use `/think` for now)
> 6. Work on my wiki → `/wiki`
> 7. Add more context → `/think codify`
> 8. Get help → `/help`
>
> (hit a number to reply, or just tell me what you need)"

### Options List (without option 0 — when gated out)

> "What would you like to do?
>
> 1. Enrich the core (research, decide, codify) → `/think`
> 2. Create ads (image or video) → `/ads`
> 3. Write a VSL script → `/vsl`
> 4. Create organic content → `/organic`
> 5. Write a newsletter → `/newsletter` (coming soon — use `/think` for now)
> 6. Work on my wiki → `/wiki`
> 7. Add more context → `/think codify`
> 8. Get help → `/help`
>
> (hit a number to reply, or just tell me what you need)"

**Option 0 — Smart Triage:** When user selects 0 (or says "what should I work on?" / "help me prioritize" / "I don't know where to start"), spawn 3 parallel read-only analysis agents. See [triage-agent.md](references/triage-agent.md) for the complete spec.

If user already stated intent, route directly without asking.

---

## Step 4: Help Mode

"Help" or confused → route to `/help`. Give quick overview first:

> "1. **vip** = engine (skills). 2. **Your repo** = data (offer, audience, voice).
> Daily: `cd vip && claude` then `/start`.
> For detailed help: `/help` + your question."

---

## Context Awareness

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Fresh (0-20%) | Full load, explain briefly |
| Working (20-70%) | Route to task |
| Heavy (70-85%) | Warn: "Finish this, then new session" |
| Critical (85%+) | "Context nearly full. Wrap up." |

Show percentage when relevant: "You're at ~60% — plenty of room."

---

## Adapt to Experience

Read `user.experience` from `~/.config/vip/local.yaml` (defaults to `beginner` if missing).

| Experience | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `beginner` | Verbose explanations, show context tips, more hand-holding |
| `intermediate` | Balanced — explain when relevant, skip basics |
| `advanced` | Minimal — get out of the way, route fast |

**First-time** (no config, thin reference): Be verbose, route to /setup
**Returning** (config exists): Quick confirmation, route by intent
**Expert** (advanced experience, clear intent): Get out of the way, route fast

**Updating experience:** If user says "I know what I'm doing" or similar, offer to update their experience level in local.yaml.

---

## Skill Quick Reference

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/pull` | Pull latest vip updates |
| `/help` | Get answers, troubleshoot, learn |
| `/setup` | Create business repo from scratch |
| `/think` | Enrich the core — research, decide, codify into reference |
| `/ads` | Generate image ads, video scripts, or review for compliance |
| `/vsl` | Write video sales letters (Skool or B2B frameworks) |
| `/organic` | Generate organic content from reference + research |
| `/newsletter` | Generate weekly newsletter from thinking work (coming soon) |
| `/site` | Generate and deploy landing pages from reference files |
| `/wiki` | Create atomic notes, publish wiki |
| `/end` | Close session — summary, crystallize, commit |

Skills like `/think` and `/ads review` automatically spawn parallel subagents when the task benefits (e.g., multi-source research, 6-lens compliance review). This makes complex work faster and keeps your main context window clean. No action needed on your part.

---

## Intent Keywords

Use these to auto-detect what user wants:

| Keywords | Route To |
|----------|----------|
| "what should I work on", "help me prioritize", "what to do next", "figure out what to work on" | Option 0 → Triage (see [triage-agent.md](references/triage-agent.md)) |
| "help", "confused", "stuck", "don't understand", "how do I" | `/help` |
| "new", "first time", "get started", "set up" | `/setup` |
| "add", "update", "more context", "new testimonials", "enrich" | `/think codify` |
| "research", "decide", "figure out", "explore", "mine", "mining", "competitors", "transcribe" | `/think` |
| "content strategy", "pillars", "platforms", "cadence", "content plan", "distribution" | `/think` |
| "soul check", "is this still right", "feeling obligated", "pull or push" | `/think codify` (soul.md review) |
| "newsletter", "email", "beehiiv", "weekly email" | `/newsletter` (coming soon — route to `/think` for now) |
| "ads", "copy", "static", "image ads", "video ads", "review", "compliance" | `/ads` |
| "vsl", "sales video", "about page video", "b2b video" | `/vsl` |
| "content", "reels", "tiktok", "organic", "carousel" | `/organic` |
| "site", "landing page", "website", "deploy site", "put this online", "I need a site" | `/site` |
| "wiki", "notes", "atomic", "wikilinks", "publish wiki" | `/wiki` |
| "pull", "update vip", "get latest" | `/pull` |
| "done", "wrapping up", "end my day", "closing out", "call it a day", "that's it" | `/end` |

---

## Recovering from Compaction

If the conversation compacts and /start is re-invoked:

1. Re-read `~/.config/vip/local.yaml` for `default_repo` and user identity
2. Re-read the business repo's context files
3. **Offer recovery:** Read `.vip/local.yaml` in the business repo for `current_offer` to restore offer context after compaction. Don't re-prompt for offer selection if the file exists — just confirm: "Restored offer context: **[offer-name]**."

---

## Remember

Router, not worker. Detect state → route → let the target skill do the work. One clarifying question max.

**Four jobs:**
1. Orient Claude to the business (load reference)
2. Assess readiness (score reference, check session state, soul health)
3. Understand what user needs (ask if unclear)
4. Route to the right skill (respecting readiness gates)
