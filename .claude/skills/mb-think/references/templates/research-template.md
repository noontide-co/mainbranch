## Grok-8 Researched Brief Variant

Use this variant when the operator passes `--brief-format=grok-8`, asks for a
researched brief, or needs the research to feed `/mb-ads`, `/mb-site`, organic
content, or a push playbook. See
[../grok-8-brief-format.md](../grok-8-brief-format.md) for the full guidance.

Add this frontmatter:

```yaml
brief_format: grok-8
linked_pushes: []
```

After `## Source Excerpts Used`, add:

```markdown
## Grok-8 Researched Brief

### 1. Business And Offering Deep Dive

### 2. ICP And Deep Audience Insights

### 3. Customer Journey And Story Mapping

### 4. Competitive And Market Landscape

### 5. Brand Archetype And Story Discovery

### 6. Technical, Functional, And Experience Requirements

### 7. Content And Asset Audit

### 8. Success Metrics And Constraints
```

After `### Implications for Reference Files`, add:

```markdown
### Downstream Handoff

| Next Surface | Ready Input | Missing Or Risky |
|---|---|---|
| `/mb-ads` | [Angles, objections, proof, audience language] | [Unknowns] |
| `/mb-site` | [Offer, audience, story, requirements, assets, metrics] | [Unknowns] |
| Push playbook | [Trigger, resource, approval gate, provider boundary] | [Unsupported/manual pieces] |
| Reference files | [Specific files to update] | [What not to codify yet] |
```

---

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Research in progress, not yet synthesized |
| `complete` | Synthesis done, ready to inform decisions |
| `codified` | Findings have been applied to reference files |
| `superseded` | Newer research replaces this |

---

## Linking to Decisions

When a decision uses this research, update the frontmatter:

```yaml
linked_decisions:
  - decisions/2026-01-17-pricing-strategy.md
  - decisions/2026-01-18-guarantee-policy.md
```

This creates a bidirectional link (research links forward to decisions, decisions link back to research).

---

# Pricing Tier Strategy Research

## Question

What pricing tier structure should we use for the community membership?

**Why this matters:** Currently one tier at $97/month. Considering adding free tier or premium tier. Need data to decide.

---

## Sources Checked

| Source | What We Found |
|--------|---------------|
| Competitor analysis (5 communities) | $47-197/month range, most have 2-3 tiers |
| Skool pricing norms | Free tier common for lead gen, paid starts at $47-97 |
| Past member feedback | 3 members mentioned wanting "advanced" content |
| Industry benchmarks (SaaS pricing research) | 3 tiers is optimal, middle tier gets 60% of signups |

---

## Raw Findings

### Competitor Pricing

- Community A: Free / $67/month / $197/month
- Community B: $97/month only (premium positioning)
- Community C: Free / $47/month (high volume)
- Community D: $147/month / $297/month (ultra-premium)
- Community E: Free / $97/month / $497/year

### Member Feedback

[Detailed quotes and feedback...]

### Industry Data

[Pricing psychology research, conversion data...]

---

## Synthesis

### One-Sentence Summary (20 words max)

Three-tier pricing with free/paid/premium maximizes reach while creating natural upgrade paths for committed members.

### Key Findings

1. Two-tier (free/paid) is minimum viable for lead generation
2. Three-tier captures both budget-conscious and power users
3. Middle tier gets 60%+ of signups in most communities
4. Annual pricing increases retention 30-40% vs monthly
5. Premium tier should be 2-3x base price, not 1.5x
6. Free tier converts 5-15% to paid within 60 days
7. "Investment" framing outperforms "deal" framing for our audience

### Implications for Reference Files

| File | Potential Update |
|------|------------------|
| `core/offer.md` | Add tier descriptions, pricing logic |
| `core/audience.md` | Segment by tier (free seeker vs committed buyer) |
| `core/proof/angles/value.md` | Update ROI math for each tier |

### Open Questions

- What should the free tier include to create desire for paid?
- Should premium be monthly or annual-only?
- How do we position the upgrade without devaluing free?
