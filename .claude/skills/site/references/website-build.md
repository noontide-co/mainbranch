# Website — Build Flow

The website shape: full multi-section site, often with a build step (Next.js, Astro, etc.), possibly with a blog, multi-offer support, knowledge base, course area. Larger surface area than a minisite; warrants component reuse and a structured site-config.

V1 status: per-offer Website generation is not yet wired (a future companion to `minisite-generation-system.md`). For now, this flow uses the legacy Next.js templates (`saas` and `high-ticket` — Devon-specific examples) as starting points. They work via Netlify deploy or Cloudflare Pages with a build step.

When per-offer Website generation ships, this file gets a sibling section for the static-or-Next.js LLM-generated path.

## Hosting decision (default: Cloudflare Pages)

For new Website builds, Cloudflare Pages is the default — better CLI, better domain integration, git auto-deploy, supports Next.js/Astro/React with build steps via build presets. Netlify works too and is documented in [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) as the legacy path; pick it only if you have specific Netlify-only needs.

For Cloudflare Pages with a build step:
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/site/scripts/pages.py create-project <name> \
  --repo-owner <owner> --repo-name <repo> --branch main
# Build settings configured in CF dashboard once: Build command (e.g., `pnpm build`), Output dir (`out` or `dist`)
```

For Netlify legacy path: see [`deployment.md`](deployment.md).

## setup (Next.js website)

**1. Choose template.** Two pre-V1 examples:
- **SaaS / Product** — Hero → Demo → Value Prop → Workflow → Examples → Integrations → CTA. Best for software, e-commerce, product companies.
- **High-Ticket Services** — Hero → Solution → Pain → Process → Competitive → Objections → Proof → Qualification → FAQ → CTA. Best for coaching, consulting, agencies, $3k+ services.

These are Devon-specific examples, not the broader Website tier. Future per-offer Website generation will produce fresh output per offer like the minisite shape.

**2. Name + location.**
- Site name (e.g., "my-landing-page")
- Location (default: `~/sites/[name]`)

**3. Check prerequisites.**
```bash
node --version    # Need 18+
pnpm --version    # Package manager
gh auth status    # GitHub CLI authenticated
```
If anything missing, install before proceeding:
- Wrong Node version → `nvm use 18`
- pnpm not found → `npm install -g pnpm`
- gh not authenticated → `gh auth login`

**4. Create GitHub repo.**
```bash
gh repo create [name] --private --clone --directory [location]
cd [location]
```

**5. Add template as upstream.**
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mainbranch-ai/site-template-[saas|high-ticket].git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories -m "Initial template merge"
```

**6. Install dependencies.**
```bash
pnpm install
```

**7. Verify build.**
```bash
pnpm build
```
If build fails, troubleshoot before proceeding. Don't deploy a broken build.

**8. Initial commit and push.**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[add] Initial site from template"
git push -u origin main
```

**9. Deploy.**
- **Cloudflare Pages (default):** `python3 .claude/skills/site/scripts/pages.py create-project <name> --repo-owner <owner> --repo-name <repo> --branch main` — git-connected, auto-deploys on push. Configure build command (`pnpm build`) + output directory (`out` or `dist`) in the CF dashboard once.
- **Netlify (legacy):** see [`deployment.md`](deployment.md). Key settings: Build command = `pnpm build`, Publish directory = `out`, NODE_VERSION = `20`.

**10. Detect business repo.** Ask: "Where is your business repo with reference files?" Confirm the path has `reference/core/` files. If the business repo has `reference/offers/`, ask which offer this site is for. Store the offer in the sites.json config.

**11. Save config.** Write `~/.mainbranch/sites.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "<site-name>",
    "site_repo": "/absolute/path/to/site-repo",
    "business_repo": "/absolute/path/to/business-repo",
    "shape": "website",
    "template": "saas",
    "hosting": "cloudflare",
    "domain": "<your-cf-pages-or-custom-apex>"
  }
]
```

Create `~/.mainbranch/` directory if it doesn't exist.

**Exit:**
> "Site deployed at https://<url>. Run `/site configure` to apply your brand, or `/site build` to start customizing sections from your reference files."

---

## configure (Next.js website)

Apply brand identity from reference files to the site's visual system.

**What it reads:**
- `voice.md` — Aesthetic direction, tone, personality
- `offer.md` — Headline copy, value proposition
- `soul.md` — Mission text, credibility elements

**What it changes:**
- `app/globals.css` — CSS custom properties (colors, fonts)
- `app/layout.tsx` — Font imports, metadata
- `site-config.ts` — Brand name, tagline, metadata

**Voice-to-aesthetic derivation:**

| Voice Trait | Design Implication |
|---|---|
| Warm, personal | Rounded corners, warm palette, serif or humanist sans display font |
| Direct, authoritative | Sharp corners, high contrast, geometric sans or strong serif |
| Playful, energetic | Bold colors, larger type scale, bouncy motion, personality fonts |
| Premium, refined | Restrained palette, ample whitespace, thin weights, serif display |
| Technical, expert | Monospace accents, structured grids, muted palette with signal color |

See [`frontend-design.md`](frontend-design.md) for font pairings, color systems, and motion guidelines.

**Steps:**
1. Read `voice.md` — determine aesthetic direction
2. Read `offer.md` — extract headline, tagline, CTA text
3. Choose font pairing based on voice (see frontend-design reference)
4. Choose color palette based on brand positioning
5. Update CSS variables in `globals.css`
6. Update font imports in `layout.tsx`
7. Update metadata (title, description, OG tags) in `layout.tsx`

**Checkpoint:**
> "Preview the brand changes? Run `/site preview` to see them locally, or continue to `/site build` to generate sections."

## build (Next.js website)

The core generation mode. Reads reference files and generates page sections.

**How it works:**
1. Resolve offer context — use offer-specific `offer.md` and `audience.md` when available
2. Read reference files from business repo (resolved paths)
3. Generate or update `site-config.ts` — the single source of all brand-specific content
4. Generate or edit component files in `components/`
5. Update page composition in `app/page.tsx`

**The site-config.ts pattern:**

All brand-specific content lives in one file. Components import from it:

```typescript
// site-config.ts
export const siteConfig = {
  brand: {
    name: "Your Business",
    tagline: "Your tagline from offer.md",
    email: "you@example.com",
  },
  hero: {
    eyebrow: "DERIVED FROM AUDIENCE.MD",
    headline: "Derived from offer.md headline",
    subhead: "Derived from offer.md value proposition",
    ctaText: "Derived from offer.md CTA",
    ctaUrl: "#pricing",
  },
  // ... sections populated from reference files
}
```

**Section types available:**

| Section Type | Purpose | Reference Source |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | Headline, subhead, CTA, badge | offer.md, audience.md |
| `reasons-grid` | Pain point cards | audience.md |
| `process-stepper` | How it works timeline | offer.md (mechanism) |
| `credibility` | Stats, testimonials, trust | testimonials.md |
| `competitive-positioning` | Why you vs alternatives | offer.md, audience.md |
| `objection-handling` | FAQ-style objection reframes | audience.md |
| `faq` | Standard Q&A accordion | offer.md, audience.md |
| `cta-simple` | Headline + button + microcopy | offer.md |
| `cta-application` | Multi-step qualification form | audience.md, offer.md |
| `examples-grid` | Use case cards | offer.md |
| `trust-strip` | Logo bar | testimonials.md |
| `interactive-explorer` | Clickable detail showcase | offer.md (features) |
| `integration-river` | Scrolling logo marquee | offer.md (integrations) |
| `footer` | Brand, contact, legal | brand info |

See [`section-patterns.md`](section-patterns.md) for detailed generation rules per section.

**Build flows:**
- **Full rebuild:** Read all reference files → regenerate `site-config.ts` → regenerate all components.
- **Add section:** Ask which section type → read relevant reference → generate component → add to `page.tsx`.
- **Edit section:** Read current component → read relevant reference → update content and copy.

**Copy guidelines:**
- Pull language directly from reference files. Don't invent marketing speak.
- Headlines from `offer.md` — the transformation, not the feature.
- Pain points from `audience.md` — their words, not generic.
- Testimonials from `testimonials.md` only — never fabricate.
- CTAs from `offer.md` — specific action, not generic "Learn More."
- If site drives traffic to Skool, cross-reference `skool-surfaces.md` for messaging consistency between the landing page and the Skool about page.

**Design guidelines:** Follow [`frontend-design.md`](frontend-design.md):
- No generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial banned)
- Bold color commitment (not safe grays)
- Hero animation is mandatory (GSAP stagger reveal)
- CTA color is sacred — nothing else shares it
- Mobile-first responsive
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

**Checkpoint:**
> "Section generated. Want to preview it, add another section, or publish?"

---

## preview (Next.js website)

Start local dev server for immediate feedback.

```bash
cd <site_repo> && pnpm dev
```

Server starts at `http://localhost:3000`. User reviews in browser, requests changes. Iterative — stay in preview until satisfied, then route to publish.

**Checkpoint:**
> "Looking good? Make changes, or publish when ready."

---

## publish (Next.js website)

Ship changes to production.

```bash
cd <site_repo> && pnpm build       # Verify build passes; fix before proceeding
git status && git diff --stat       # Review changes
git add -A
git commit -m "[update] Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys on push (per the git-connected project from setup step 9). Netlify legacy path also auto-deploys on push.

**Exit:**
> "Pushed to GitHub. Cloudflare will auto-deploy in ~1-2 minutes (or Netlify if you set up legacy). Live URL: https://<domain>."

## Graduating to a website with CMS

When the website grows past ~10 pages or content needs to be edited by non-developers, `/site` supports bolting on a CMS. See [`graduation.md`](graduation.md) for the Sanity / Contentful / Notion-as-CMS / etc. paths.
