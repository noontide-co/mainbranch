# CLAUDE.md Guide

How to draft an effective CLAUDE.md for a business repo.

---

## Purpose

Your entire repo is a precision instrument for LLM context quality. Every file should earn its place. CLAUDE.md is the lightest layer — summaries and pointers, not full content.

CLAUDE.md is the **always-loaded business brain**. Claude reads this file at the start of every session. It should contain:

- Enough context to work effectively
- Pointers to deeper reference files
- Current state and key decisions

**Not too much** — keep it scannable. Put deep details in reference files.

---

## Structure

```markdown
# [Business Name]

[One sentence: What this business is]

---

## Main Branch

This folder contains your **business files**. Main Branch adds the `mb` CLI
and skills around those files.

**Setup:**
1. Start Claude in THIS folder (your business folder) and run `/mb-start`
2. Main Branch is linked via `.claude/settings.local.json` (with bridge links as compatibility fallback)

**How it works:**
- `mb` CLI: Checks setup, status, readiness, repairs, and updates.
- Skills: Read `core/`, `research/`, and `decisions/`, then write coordinated work to `pushes/`.
- This folder: Contains the business context you own and edit.

**If `/mb-start` isn't available:** Run `mb skill link --repo .`, then restart
Claude. For old clone-era installs, use `docs/migrating.md`.

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | File |
|----------|------|
| [Decision 1] | `decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| [Decision 2] | `decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |

---

## Reference Tiers

| Tier | What | When Loaded |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Always** | This CLAUDE.md | Every session |
| **Core** | core/*.md | When generating content |
| **On-demand** | research/, decisions/ | When reasoning about choices |
| **Deep reference** | core/brand/, core/proof/ | When writing copy |
| **Domain** | core/operations/ | When business-type matters |

---

## Work Continuity

- Active bets: `bets/`
- Active pushes: `pushes/`
- Decisions that explain direction: `decisions/`
- Team handoffs and daily records: `log/`
- Use GitHub issues only when work needs a durable thread across sessions,
  proposals, releases, or team visibility.

This gives `/mb-start` business-language routing hints without creating a
separate work-management surface.
```

### Avoid

## Progressive Disclosure

CLAUDE.md is **Tier 1** — always loaded, so keep it lean.

Pattern:
1. **Summary in CLAUDE.md** — Quick reference
2. **Pointer to full file** — "Full system: `core/voice.md`"
3. **Claude loads on-demand** — When actually needed

Example:
```markdown
## Voice (Quick Reference)

**Tone:** Calm, grounded, never preachy
**Key phrases:** "Wearable notes to self", "Stay awake. Stay happy."

**Full system:** `core/voice.md`
```

---

## Length Guidelines

- **Ideal:** 100-300 lines
- **Maximum:** 500 lines
- **If longer:** Move content to reference files

CLAUDE.md shares context window with everything else. Keep it tight.

---

## Update Cadence

Update CLAUDE.md when:
- Business state changes significantly
- New major decisions are made
- Strategy shifts
- Key metrics update (quarterly)

Don't update for:
- Every small change
- New research (goes in `research/`)
- New testimonials (goes in `proof/`)
